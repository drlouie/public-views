theTitle=ALLERGAN&theDescription=Allergan wanted to update their annual Authors' Reception Catalog for the year 2001. The solution was to create an interactive CD-ROM for the 2000 Authors' Reception and to archive Allergan's 50th anniversary of past receptions. The CD begins with an animated introduction highlighting Allergan, its employees, and staff. The program provides users the opportunity to choose from the current catalog or previous years' catalogs.
