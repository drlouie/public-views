To update your Project Galleries follow these easy directions.



The following folders contain the data that runs these Project/Photo Galleries:

thumbnails (images) :: 		example 1 ( ADH_thumb_1.jpg )	example 2 ( FAB_thumb_1.jpg )
largePhotos (photos) :: 	example 1 ( ADH_large_1.jpg )	example 2 ( FAB_large_2.jpg )
itemDescription (data) ::	example 1 ( ADH_1.txt )		example 2 ( FAB_2.txt )





The following file names reflect the various Project/Photo Galleries:

ADH_ ( adhesive.html / adhesive.swf )
FAB_ ( fabric.html / fabric.swf )
VEH_ ( vehicles.html / vehicles.swf )
VIN_ ( vinyl.html / vinyl.swf )





SAMPLE:
To update the ADHESIVE gallery follow these steps:

1. Find out how many items/projects will be presented in the ADHESIVE gallery.

2. Since we are updating the ADHESIVE gallery, open adhesive.html.
   At the very top of the document you will find ( ADH_COUNT = 8; ), 
   change this number to the number you got in step 1 : the number of items/projects ADHESIVE gallery will parse.

   ** All html pages contain this same layout **
   ** Number MUST match the number of thumbnails/largePhotos/itemDescriptions with the ADH_ naming convention**

3. Test and Serve!
