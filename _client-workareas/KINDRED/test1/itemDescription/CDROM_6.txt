theTitle=Shipmate - Training and Certification CD-ROM&theDescription=ShipMate needed a way to provide clients with a more effective teaching tool on shipping hazardous material than in the traditional fashion, while also providing Hazmat certification. A computer-based training program (CBT) was designed and divided into modules like chapters in a book. Each module closes with a quiz, leading the user into the next module and eventually to a final exam. Upon completion of the final exam, the user is provided with a certificate of completion.
