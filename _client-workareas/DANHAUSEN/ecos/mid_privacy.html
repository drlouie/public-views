<p class="paragraphtext">At LightSite.net, your privacy matters. We created 
    our LightSite.net privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to 
    protecting our customers' privacy.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="paragraphtext"> LightSite collects and processes information for specified, 
    legitimate purposes. We have not and will not give away, trade, or sell information 
    obtained from our customers or site visitors. The following discloses our 
    processes for gathering and disseminating information for LightSite. </p>
  <p class="paragraphtext">We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with 
    our server, and to administer our Web site. IP addresses are used in aggregate 
    form for traffic analysis. </p>
  <p class="paragraphtext">Our site's registration form requires users to submit 
    contact information (like their name and email address). We use customer contact 
    information from the registration form to send the user information about 
    our company. If you would specifically prefer not to receive any follow-up 
    mailings or email contact from us after your site visit, see the Choice/Opt-Out 
    section below. </p>
  <p class="paragraphtext">LightSite contains links to other sites. LightSite 
    is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites. 
  </p>
  <p class="paragraphtext">LightSite is owned by Ecos Consulting, Inc. (www.ecosconsulting.com), 
    which stores and protects all information provided by customers. We conduct 
    a number of energy-saving lighting programs on behalf of electric utilities 
    in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wisconsin and Illinois. 
    Our contracts with those utilities often require us to keep customer information 
    confidential, only sharing it with utility program managers and the survey 
    teams who verify our program results. </p>
  <p class="paragraphtext">Our site uses an order form for customers to request 
    information, products, and services. We collect visitors' contact information 
    (their email address) and financial information (their account or credit card 
    numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders to 
    our customers, and financial information is used, of course, to bill customers 
    for purchases. </p>
  <p class="paragraphtext">In the interest of improving customer service, we occasionally 
    survey a fraction of users about their site experience. If you tell us you 
    don't wish to receive such inquiries, we won't send them to you. </p>
  <p class="paragraphtext">From time to time, we may run contests or promotions 
    on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their email 
    address). We use contact data from our contests to send users information 
    about our company. We also use this contact data, such as email address, to 
    notify our contest winners. </p>
  <p class="paragraphtext"><b class="paragraphtitlewhite">Security</b><br>
    This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration 
    of the information under our control. We use VeriSign (hotlinked to http://www.verisign.com) 
    Secure Site Services. Our VeriSign Secure Server ID works in conjunction with 
    Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, which is the standard protocol for 
    secure, Web-based communications. VeriSign's Seal was voted the #1 sign of 
    trust on the Internet (Cheskin/Studio Archetype Study). We use Secure Socket 
    Layers at the highest possible encryption strength that customers' browsers 
    are capable of handling. In addition, financial information is protected by 
    our ISP's network procedures. All LightSite.net employees are aware of these 
    security procedures (via internal education) and are periodically briefed 
    on any new security considerations. </p>
  <p class="paragraphtext"><b class="paragraphtitlewhite">Choice/Opt-Out<br>
    </b>LightSite 
    provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from 
    us and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor.
