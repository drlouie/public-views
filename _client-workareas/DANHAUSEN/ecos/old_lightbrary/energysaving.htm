      <h2 class="paragraphtitle">Improving Your Home Means Improving Your Energy 
        Bill.</h2>
      <p class="paragraphtext">TOLEDO, Ohio, Sept. 24 /PRNewswire/ - Are you spending 
        too much money each month on utility bills by wasting energy? The U.S. 
        Department of Energy says that most Americans can reduce their utility 
        bills by 10 to 50 percent by undertaking a few simple home improvement 
        projects. Considering that the average household now spends more than 
        $110 per month on energy, a relatively small investment can quickly pay 
        significant dividends. Besides reducing your utility bills, an energy-efficient 
        home is more comfortable and benefits the environment by requiring fewer 
        fossil fuels to be burned, which produce greenhouse gas emissions that 
        contribute to global warming.<br>

      <h2 class="paragraphtitle">10 Simple, Energy-Efficient, Do-It-Yourself Home 
        Improvements.</h2>
      <p><span class=paragraphtitleblue>"R" You Up to Code?</span><br>
        <span class="paragraphtext">One of the best and easiest ways to save energy, 
        cut heating and cooling costs, and make a home more comfortable is to 
        add attic insulation. The Department of Energy's new guidelines recommend 
        R-49 insulation (equivalent to 15 inches of fiber glass) for the attics 
        of most U.S. homes. Because most attics only have 6 or 7 inches of insulation, 
        adding a layer may help the majority of homeowners increase the energy 
        efficiency of their homes. One product that makes the job of adding insulation 
        easier for do-it-yourselfers is Owens Corning's virtually itch-free MIRAFLEX(R) 
        R-25 (8-3/4-inch-thick) insulation. Contact the Energy Department for 
        your area's specific R-values, which are determined by local heating/cooling 
        costs and the climate. Also be sure to check the insulation in your exterior 
        and basement walls, floors and crawl spaces to see if it meets the Department 
        of Energy R-values recommended for your area (the higher the R-value, 
        the greater the insulating power).</span></p>
      <p><br>
        <span class=paragraphtitleblue>Plug the Drafts</span><br>
        <span class="paragraphtext">Warm air leaking into your home during the 
        summer and out of your home during the winter can waste energy. However, 
        draft-proofing your home can cut energy costs by up to 10 percent, according 
        to the Energy Department. The exterior of your house is your first line 
        of defense against drafts, so caulk, seal and weather-strip around all 
        seams, cracks and openings. Pay special attention around windows and where 
        siding or bricks and wood trim meet. You can also reduce drafts from the 
        inside of the house by caulking, sealing and weather-stripping around 
        windows and door frames, and near electrical boxes and plumbing fixtures, 
        all of which are likely locations for air leaks.</span></p>
      <p><br>
        <span class=paragraphtitleblue>Window Wise</span><br>
        <span class="paragraphtext">The energy wasted through poorly insulated 
        windows and doors is equal to about as much energy as we obtain from the 
        Alaska pipeline each year! If your windows rattle from the wind, or are 
        swollen, rotted or drafty, consider replacing them with high-efficiency, 
        easy to maintain double-pane vinyl windows or install storm windows over 
        single-pane windows. Double- and triple-pane windows have insulated air- 
        or gas-filled spaces between each pane, which resist heat flow.</span></p>
      <p><br>
        <span class=paragraphtitleblue>Insulate Your Water Heater</span><br>
        <span class="paragraphtext">Water-heating costs are the third largest 
        energy expense in a home, typically accounting for about 14 percent of 
        the utility bill. An old water heater that is warm to the touch usually 
        needs additional insulation. Installing an insulation blanket around the 
        water storage tank is an economical way to help make heating water more 
        efficient. If you're purchasing a new water heater, an energy-efficient 
        system will help reduce operating costs. Save additional money by lowering 
        your water heater's temperature to 115 degrees F (140 degrees F if you 
        use a dishwasher). And if you have an electric water heater, consider 
        installing an electric water heater timer.</span></p>
      <p><br>
        <span class=paragraphtitleblue>Check Your Equipment</span><br>
        <span class="paragraphtext">Heating and cooling a home uses more energy 
        than any other system in your home  typically 44 percent of your overall 
        utility bill. Properly maintaining and adjusting existing equipment can 
        improve energy efficiency by as much as 10 percent. Have your furnace 
        and air ducts checked and serviced once a year, and change forced air 
        heating system air filters each month to ensure maximum energy efficiency. 
        Clean air registers, baseboard heaters and radiators as needed, and close 
        vents in rooms used infrequently.</span></p>
      <p><br>
        <span class=paragraphtitleblue>Shedding New Light</span><br>
        <span class="paragraphtext">Another way to save money is to replace your 
        home's incandescent light bulbs with high-efficiency compact fluorescent 
        bulbs. According to the Department of Energy, replacing just 25 percent 
        of incandescent bulbs in high- use areas with compact fluorescents could 
        cut your lighting costs in half. Also make sure to turn off lights in 
        rooms not being used, and "light zone" your home by concentrating lighting 
        in reading and working areas as well as where it's needed for safety, 
        such as in stairwells. Finally, install timers rather than leaving lights 
        on continuously when you're away from home.</span></p>
      <p><br>
        <span class=paragraphtitleblue>Shoot for the Stars</span><br>
        <span class="paragraphtext">When shopping for a new appliance, look for 
        the ENERGY STAR(R) label. These appliances have been identified by the 
        Department of Energy and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as 
        the most energy-efficient products in their classes. Look for the ENERGY 
        STAR label on dishwashers, air conditioners, windows, washing machines, 
        refrigerators, thermostats, insulation, lighting fixtures, computers and 
        homes. A new refrigerator with the ENERGY STAR label, for example, will 
        save between $35 and $70 a year compared to the models designed 10 years 
        ago, adding between $525 and $1,050 in savings over the average 15-20 
        year life of the unit.</span></p>
      <p><br>
        <span class=paragraphtitleblue>Get with the Program</span><br>
        <span class="paragraphtext">You can save up to 10 percent a year on heating 
        and cooling bills by turning your thermostat back 10 to 15 percent for 
        eight hours a day. You can do this automatically without sacrificing comfort 
        by installing an automatic setback or programmable thermostat, which enables 
        you to adjust the times you turn on the heating or air conditioning according 
        to a preset schedule. As a result, you don't operate the equipment as 
        much when you are asleep or when the house is unoccupied. Programmable 
        thermostats can store and repeat multiple daily settings that can be overridden 
        manually without affecting the rest of the program.</span></p>
      <p><br>
        <span class=paragraphtitleblue>Slow the Flow</span><br>
        <span class="paragraphtext">Make sure your kitchen sink faucet has an 
        aerator and consider installing a low-flow shower head. By reducing the 
        amount of water in the flow, you use less hot water and save the energy 
        that would have been required to heat it. Moreover, the lower water pressure 
        is barely noticeable.</span></p>
      <p><br>
        <span class=blueheader><span class="paragraphtitleblue">Up on the Roof</span><br>
        </span><span class="paragraphtext">Ventilation plays a large role in providing 
        moisture control and reducing summer cooling bills. An improperly ventilated 
        home can damage the structural wood and roofing system of the home and 
        make living uncomfortable. Roof vents should be located along the entire 
        ceiling cavity to help ensure proper airflow from the soffit to the attic. 
        They're designed to help keep the air flow in your attic constant, reducing 
        the level of developing moisture in the winter and venting hot air in 
        the summer. Consumers can learn more about optimizing their home's energy 
        efficiency in a 36-page free booklet called "Energy Savers." Developed 
        by the Department of Energy in partnership with Owens Corning and Honeywell, 
        the booklet includes more than 100 easy and practical energy-efficient 
        tips and projects. Consumers can receive a copy of the booklet by calling
