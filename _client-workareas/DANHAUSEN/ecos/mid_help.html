      <p class="paragraphtext">At LightSite.net, your privacy matters. We created 
        our LightSite.net privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment 
        to protecting our customers' privacy.<br>
      </p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"> LightSite collects and processes information for 
        specified, legitimate purposes. We have not and will not give away, trade, 
        or sell information obtained from our customers or site visitors. The 
        following discloses our processes for gathering and disseminating information 
        for LightSite. </p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">We use your IP address to help diagnose problems 
        with our server, and to administer our Web site. IP addresses are used 
        in aggregate form for traffic analysis. </p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">Our site's registration form requires users to 
        submit contact information (like their name and email address). We use 
        customer contact information from the registration form to send the user 
        information about our company. If you would specifically prefer not to 
        receive any follow-up mailings or email contact from us after your site 
        visit, see the Choice/Opt-Out section below. </p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">LightSite contains links to other sites. LightSite 
        is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites. 
      </p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">LightSite is owned by Ecos Consulting, Inc. (www.ecosconsulting.com), 
        which stores and protects all information provided by customers. We conduct 
        a number of energy-saving lighting programs on behalf of electric utilities 
        in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wisconsin and Illinois. 
        Our contracts with those utilities often require us to keep customer information 
        confidential, only sharing it with utility program managers and the survey 
        teams who verify our program results. </p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">Our site uses an order form for customers to request 
        information, products, and services. We collect visitors' contact information 
        (their email address) and financial information (their account or credit 
        card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send 
        orders to our customers, and financial information is used, of course, 
        to bill customers for purchases. </p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">In the interest of improving customer service, 
        we occasionally survey a fraction of users about their site experience. 
        If you tell us you don't wish to receive such inquiries, we won't send 
        them to you. </p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">From time to time, we may run contests or promotions 
        on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their 
        email address). We use contact data from our contests to send users information 
        about our company. We also use this contact data, such as email address, 
        to notify our contest winners. </p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"><b class="paragraphtitle">Security</b><br>
        This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and 
        alteration of the information under our control. We use VeriSign (hotlinked 
        to http://www.verisign.com) Secure Site Services. Our VeriSign Secure 
        Server ID works in conjunction with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, 
        which is the standard protocol for secure, Web-based communications. VeriSign's 
        Seal was voted the #1 sign of trust on the Internet (Cheskin/Studio Archetype 
        Study). We use Secure Socket Layers at the highest possible encryption 
        strength that customers' browsers are capable of handling. In addition, 
        financial information is protected by our ISP's network procedures. All 
        LightSite.net employees are aware of these security procedures (via internal 
        education) and are periodically briefed on any new security considerations.

        from us and our partners at the point where we request information about
