              do we use light bulbs and light fixtures in our homes? The answer 
              is simple, really: because it gets dark at night and we don't want 
              to bump into things. Even during the daytime we often need some 
              kind of artificial lighting, because it's hard to get sunlight into 
              every room of the home or office. And, of course, sunlight doesn't 
              have a dimmer switch -- we pretty much get what nature gives us.</span></span></span></span><span class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">

        the 1700s</i><br>
        </span><span class="paragraphtext">For most of human history, people had 
        to build a fire if they wanted extra light. That had its drawbacks, of 
        course: fire is a better source of heat than light and tends to burn out 
        quickly. </span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">So, about 5,000 years ago, the candle was developed 
        to provide a more reliable, long-lived light source. By the 1700s, people 
        began putting lanterns around them to keep them from blowing out in the 
        wind, and reflectors behind them to help aim the meager light they provided. 
        They also figured out that the wick could be dunked in oil, which was 
        at that time obtained from whale blubber. <i>As a result, many types of 
        whales hunted for their precious blubber nearly became extinct</i> (is 
        it any wonder that environmentalists care about lighting?)</p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">As time went on, some manufacturers switched from 
        oil lamps to gas lamps, and people began connecting central natural gas 
        lines to their houses. This made it possible for the first time for lights 
        to operate unattended in the home (parents have been nagging their kids 
        to switch off the lights when they leave the room ever since).<br>

            <p class="paragraphtitle"><i>It's Electrifying: the 1800's<br>
              </i><span class="paragraphtext">Finally, in the mid-1800s, a Russian 
              named Paul Nicolaievitch Jablochkoff found a way to produce light 
              reliably without a flame, using a continuous electric spark. This 
              made him very popular at parties, but nobody could pronounce his 
              name, so they just called him Sparky. His electric arc lamps consumed 
              huge amounts of electricity, and were very expensive to build and 
              maintain. </span></p>
            <p class="paragraphtext">A physicist named James Prescott Joule made 
              a cool discovery around that same time: if you run enough electricity 
              through certain fibers or metals, they glow white hot, producing 
              a very bright light. Of course he had to look fast; by the time 
              these filaments starting glowing white hot, they usually burned 
              up a few seconds later. So Joule discovered the principle of incandescence 
              and got the Joule Effect named after him, but missed out on the 
              big bucks by not finding a way to turn this discovery into a light 
              bulb. <br>
              <br>
              Between 1860 and 1878, a British chap named Sir Joseph Swan started 
              building light bulbs. Their filaments were enclosed in a glass bulb 
              from which all the air had been pumped out. But every time he tried 
              to show one of his prototypes to the public, the filament would 
              burn up. This explains why Sir Swan is remembered by a few stuffy 
              historians as the inventor of the ultra-disposable light bulb, while 
              Thomas Edison is the most famous inventor in history. </p>

      <p class="paragraphtext">Edison raised a bunch of money in the 1870s by 
        telling stockholders that his light bulb was nearly done (like he always 
        said, genius was 99 percent making stuff up and only 1 percent sweat, 
        or something like that). With the money in hand, he set out to build his 
        first working prototype, which took 5 years. In 1879, his first successful 
        light bulb used a carbon-cotton filament and burned a whopping 40 hours 
        before failing, which was quite an accomplishment at the time. Edison 
        built the first central power plant about a year later in New York City, 
        figuring he'd sell more light bulbs if people could actually switch them 
        on (genius!) Actually, the guy knew a good business when he saw one. His 
        Edison Illuminating Company eventually became General Electric and he 
        became a major stockholder, which explains why Edison's kids didn't need 
        to sweat as much as dear old dad, if you get our drift…</p>
      <p class="paragraphtitle"><i>Tweaks and Tune-Ups<br>
        </i><span class="paragraphtext">Various improvements were made to the 
        filament over the next few decades, including the use of tungsten, which 
        succeeded in extending bulb life and increasing light output. In 1959, 
        scientists discovered that adding halogen gases inside the bulb helped 
        even more, by encouraging the tungsten that boiled off of the filament 
        to redeposit. This allowed the light bulbs to run hotter without burning 
        out prematurely and explains the term tungsten halogen bulb.</span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">The problem was, each of these developments perpetuated 
        the original link between heat and light that began with the cave dwellers. 
        Whether through campfires, candles, gas jets, electric sparks, or hot 
        filaments, we were still heating up wood, a wick or a wire to make light, 
        which is kind of a dumb way to do things. In fact, even in the best designs, 
        80 to 90 percent of the energy consumed was producing heat, which was 
        often undesirable, while only 10 to 20 percent was producing visible light 
        that people could use for not bumping into things.</p>
      <p class="paragraphtitle"><i>Totally Tubular - The Birth of the Fluorescent 
        Lamp<br>
        </i><span class="paragraphtext">In the 1930s, scientists finally broke 
        this link between heat and light by producing the first fluorescent lamp. 
        By energizing mercury gas inside of a long tube, they could make the tube 
        fluoresce - giving off ultraviolet (UV) light when the charged vapor returned 
        to its normal, uncharged state. This purplish light would have been awesome 
        for making the scientists' black light velvet posters glow in the dark, 
        but those posters weren't really popular until the 1970s. </span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">So instead, they figured out how to coat the inside 
        of the lamps with chalky chemicals called phosphors, which helped convert 
        the UV into visible light. Still, those early fluorescent lights were 
        pretty ghastly, and convinced a lot of people that they looked like cadavers 
        under fluorescent light. Indeed, some cheap fluorescents sold today continue 
        to have that same cold, blue color, because they only use one halo-phosphor. 
        These products give fluorescent light a bad rap, although they work well 
        in morgues… Fortunately there are far better fluorescent lights available 
        now, including the ones available here at LightSite.</p>
      <p class="paragraphtitle"><i>Not Your Father's Fluorescents<br>
        </i><span class="paragraphtext"><span class="indenter">Eventually scientists 
        figured out that they could combine three different phosphors (red, blue 
        and green) to get a much more natural, white-looking light. These tri-phosphor 
        or tri-stimulus phosphor lamps are more expensive than the halo-phosphor 
        variety, but produce far better color and are also significantly more 
        energy efficient. Unlike incandescent bulbs, they turn much more of their 
        electricity into light instead of heat, making them safer as well.</span></span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">Fluorescent lamps sold relatively well in the 1950s, 
        60s and 70s, but were still pretty bulky and hard to fit in many places 
        in the home. The lamps were 4 or even 8 feet long, and often buzzed and 
        flickered when they were on. The circuit that made them work, the magnetic 
        ballast, was to blame. It switched the lamp on and off only 60 times per 
        second, which was slow enough for many people to see a headache-inducing 
        strobing effect and for most people to hear an annoying buzz.</p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">By the late 1970s, scientists figured out how to 
        make a high frequency or electronic ballast that solved both problems. 
        It switched the lamp on and off more than 25,000 times per second - so 
        fast that it couldn't be seen or heard by anyone but Superman (who had 
        X-Ray vision and didn't need lighting anyway). This very high tech gizmo 
        is a lot smaller than a typical magnetic ballast, and can fit in tight 
        spaces. At almost the same time, scientists began making shorter, skinnier 
        fluorescent tubes that could be folded or curved into really cool, compact 
        shapes.</p>

              </i><span class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">And 
              so, in 1980, the compact fluorescent lamp or CFL was born. This 
              bulb could be screwed into a regular light socket like an incandescent 
              light bulb, using only 18 or 20 watts of power to provide as much 
              light as a normal 60 watt light bulb.</span></span></p>
            <p class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">Over time, manufacturers 
              have become increasingly clever at finding ways to fold those tubes 
              into smaller and smaller spaces. Today's CFLs are generally pretty 
              close to the size of typical light bulbs, and come in a number of 
              funky shapes like U-shaped, circular, tubular, coiled, and even 
              pretzel (sort of). Chances are, you can now find one to fit in almost 
              any light socket in the house, and LightSite offers more types than 
              you'll find almost anywhere else.</span></p>

      <p class="paragraphtext">Manufacturers also began offering compact fluorescent 
        lamps with metal pins at the base rather than a round socket. Instead 
        of screwing them into existing fixtures, you plug these lamps into the 
        ballasts of dedicated fixtures, which are designed to work only with fluorescent 
        sources. Since the ballasts usually last longer than the fluorescent lamps 
        and cost more, this is a smart idea that can save you money.</p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">These dedicated fixtures come in two key varieties: 
        hard-wired or permanent fixtures and portable fixtures. The first kind 
        is usually connected directly to the wall or ceiling or mounted outside, 
        and controlled by a wall switch, while the second kind can be used anywhere 
        there is an electric outlet and usually provides its own switch. </p>

              </i><span class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">It's 
              easy to get very technical when it comes to lighting, but we can 
              cover the basics here. Light is a type of electromagnetic radiation, 
              just like radio waves or microwaves. Our eyes just happen to be 
              sensitive to the part of the spectrum that falls between infrared 
              and ultraviolet light, so we call that "visible light." The main 
              colors of the visible spectrum are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, 
              indigo and violet.</span></span></p>
            <p class="paragraphtitle"><span class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">What 
              we call "white" light normally consists of some of each of those 
              colors. The sun tends to give relatively equal emphasis to all of 
              the colors. By contrast, incandescent light emphasizes reddish tones, 
              but is weak in the blues and greens. Fluorescent light is stronger 
              in the blues and greens, but tends to underemphasize reddish colors. 
              Of course, fluorescent lighting is available in a wide variety of 
              color palettes, so it should be possible to find one that meets 
              your needs.</span></span></p>

      <p class="paragraphtitle"><i>Types of Light Sources</i><br>
        <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">We use artificial 
        light sources as a substitute for sunlight in the home. Some provide general 
        illumination throughout the room, and are referred to as ambient light 
        sources. Others are focused on a particular area where we might be working, 
        such as a desk or kitchen countertop. These are referred to as task lighting. 
        Still others are intended to highlight something in the room with a pool 
        of light that stands out from the ambient light around it. These are called 
        accent lighting. </span></span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">LightSite includes 
        mostly ambient light sources, but offers a few task fixtures as well. 
        Torchieres are a special kind of ambient light, because they do their 
        lighting indirectly. Their light shines on the ceiling and is then reflected 
        back into the room as a soft, diffuse glow, similar to the bright sky 
        that provides shadowless, even illumination when the sun is behind a cloud. 
        No wonder people like indirect lighting - it reminds us of being outside!</span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtitle"><i>Living a Glare-free Life</i><br>
        <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">Good lighting 
        is a subjective thing, and varies enormously according to personal taste 
        and preference. However, certain general practices have become standardized 
        over the years to achieve lighting that is pleasing to most people. These 
        include recommended levels of lighting for particular tasks, and some 
        recommended advice about avoiding glare. Some of this can get fairly complicated 
        - for now, here is our basic advice about avoiding glare. </span></span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtitle"><span class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">Glare 
        happens most frequently when one source of light is dramatically brighter 
        than the others around it and shines directly at you or bounces into your 
        eyes. Some differences in lighting levels within a room can create visual 
        interest, but too great of a difference often causes glare. With particularly 
        bright light sources, be sure that a diffuser or reflector prevents you 
        from seeing the bulb directly. This will help reduce glare and make the 
        users of the space more comfortable.</span></span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtitle"><span class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">If 
        you need an even, diffuse source of light, consider purchasing a linear 
        fluorescent instead of a series of compact fluorescents. Linear fluorescents 
        tend to offer higher energy efficiency, longer lifetime, and bright, diffuse 
        light just where you need it.</span></span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtitle"><i>Smart Bulb Shopping</i><br>
        <span class="paragraphtext">How do you know which bulbs to buy? Virtually 
        every light bulb on the market provides three key pieces of information 
        on a standard label: light output (lumens), power usage (watts), and lifetime 
        (hours). To save money, improve comfort, and prevent pollution, you need 
        to read and understand that label. It is your key to understanding why 
        some light bulbs are worth far more than others. In lighting, as in many 
        products, you get what you pay for. </span></p>

        Lighting: How to Get the Most for Your Money<br>
        </i><span class="paragraphtext">The easiest way to see the differences 
        between the various types of light bulbs is to take an actual example. 
        Suppose you are about to buy a 75 watt incandescent light bulb. What are 
        your alternatives? There are three main ones: full-spectrum incandescent, 
        halogen, and compact fluorescent. </span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">"Full-spectrum" bulbs

        bulbs claim to provide a whiter light, last longer, and reduce energy 
        use. Compact fluorescents also claim to last longer and reduce energy 
        use, while providing a softer light. Can they all be right? </span></p>

            You've just discovered a key lighting principle: energy efficiency. 
            In cars, we measure that with miles per gallon (MPG). Energy efficient

            fluorescent provides more than 5 times as many lumens per watt as 
            the full spectrum incandescent. That's like replacing a 20 miles per

        Save Money, Save the Environment, Save Lives </i></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"><b>The Problem</b><br>
        <span class="paragraphtext">Lighting accounts for about 15% of a typical 
        household's electricity bill. That translates into an incredible $11 billion 
        a year worth of utility bills nationwide.</span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">Home lighting currently 
        accounts for about 3% of all U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, which contribute 
        to global warming. It also causes about 4% of the sulfur oxides pollution 
        that causes acid rain, and about 2% of nitrogen oxides pollution that 
        causes urban smog. That may not seem as big as other energy users like 
        air conditioners or diesel trucks, but remember that virtually everyone 
        in the country can help prevent pollution through better home lighting. 
        </span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext"><b>The Solution</b></span><br>
        <span class="paragraphtext">Energy efficient lighting products like the 
        ones offered at LightSite can reduce electricity use by 60 to 80%, depending 
        on the application. But what does that really mean for the environment?</span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">If you consume less 
        electricity in your home or office, the utilities need to generate less 
        electricity at the power plant. That means they burn fewer fossil fuels 
        and cause less air pollution. In other words, you can help the environment, 
        immediately and directly, by switching to efficient lighting products 
        and using them wisely.</span></p>

              bulbs and fixtures also operate at much lower temperatures, which

              already caused more than 430 fires, and light bulbs of all types 
              cause about 2,800 fires and 25 deaths per year. It pays to use cooler-running 
              lighting products to make your home a safer place, especially in 
              children's rooms and any place where pets or kids could knock over

              bulbs. By that measure, fluorescent lamps are the clear leader,

            <p class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">Most people prefer 
              to use light bulbs providing about 1700 to 2800 lumens of light 
              output for reading (100 to 150 watts in an incandescent bulb). As

      <p class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">One more thing: if 
        you want a CFL for reading with a table or floor lamp, consider using 
        a circular or 2D lamp. These lamps are especially designed to curve around 
        the outside of the metal harp that supports the shades of most table and 
        floor lamps. They also aim most of their light up and down (toward what 
        you are reading) rather than sideways (out into the room).</span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"><i class="paragraphtextwhite"><span class="paragraphtitle">Q: 
        </span>I've heard that CFLs don't always last as long as the manufacturers 
        claim. Is that true?</i></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtitle">A:</span> 
        Sometimes. This is one of our most complicated subjects at LightSite, 
        but here are the key issues. Lifetime is determined with an official test 
        procedure in which numerous samples of a light bulb are repeatedly switched 
        on for 3 hours and off for 20 minutes. Median (average) lifetime is measured 
        at the number of elapsed operating hours when half of the samples have 
        failed. In other words, if a light bulb is rated to last for 10,000 hours, 
        normally half of those models will fail prior to that point, and half 
        will fail later. Manufacturers try to minimize the amount of this variation 
        within a particular model, but random chance will still play a role in 
        whether your specific bulb lasts a bit longer or shorter than its rated 
        lifetime. </span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">Remember that the lifetime 
        of regular light bulbs is determined mostly by total hours of use, whereas 
        CFL lifetime is often more strongly affected by total number of times 
        the lamp is switched on and off.</span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">For example, the <u>Lighting 
        Research Center</u> (LRC) recently found that some compact fluorescent 
        lamps would only last about 500 to 2000 hours when switched repeatedly 
        on for 5 minutes and off for 20 seconds. By contrast, the same products 
        were found to last about 8 times longer if switched on for 3 hours and 
        switched off for 20 minutes. What a difference! It pays to use CFLs in 
        sockets where they will be on for a couple of hours at a time.</span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">There are differences 
        between individual manufacturers as well. The same LRC test procedure, 
        although it only tested 4 samples of each bulb, found that some manufacturers' 
        CFLs failed on the standard test as early as 4,000 hours, while others' 
        had been running nearly 20,000 hours and still hadn't failed yet. Click 
        here to see the whole report, and remember that manufacturers have already 
        made many improvements in their products since this research was conducted. 
        Also remember that LightSite has chosen products that we feel will provide 
        good performance and long life, and we stand behind that with a <u>money-back 
        guarantee</u>.</span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">There are also a few 
        tips for how to use your CFL to maximize its life. Don't use it on a timer 
        or motion sensor unless that control specifically says it's OK to use 
        with CFLs. Putting CFLs in a really hot place, like a completely enclosed 
        light fixture with no air circulation, may also shorten their life. </span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext">Finally, remember that 
        CFLs last far longer than incandescent or halogen bulbs on average, and 
        are still the best choice by far when you want to avoid the hassle of 
        frequent bulb replacements. </span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"><i class="paragraphtextwhite"><span class="paragraphtitle">Q: 
        </span>Can I just replace the halogen bulb in my torchiere with a CFL 
        to save energy and make it safer?</i></p>
      <p class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtitle">A: 
        </span>This is probably the most common question we have received at LightSite. 
        Although we know of one manufacturer that is working on a prototype that 
        would convert halogen torchieres to fluorescent, we think the chances 
        of its success are still low, for three reasons:</span></p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="paragraphtext">Torchieres have two electrical contacts 
          118 millimeters apart that are designed to hold a halogen bulb under 
          spring tension. It is tough to convert a standard screw-based CFL to 
          connect to those contacts, fit within the torchiere bowl, and be stable 
          enough not to fall out.</span></li>
        <li><span class="paragraphtext">2. Underwriters Laboratories (UL) certification 
          would be needed for this retrofit kit, but would be very difficult to 
          get, since the manufacturer would have to prove that the kit could work 
          safely with every major type of halogen torchiere on the market.</span></li>
        <li><span class="paragraphtext">3. The liability risk for the manufacturer 
          of such a retrofit kit could be high. Many halogen torchieres are very 
          cheaply made, and their circuitry could cause problems with a retrofit 
          kit, even if it used very high quality circuits. Just getting a retrofit 
          kit to work reliably and consistently with the dimmers in most halogen 
          torchieres would be hard enough.</span></li>
      </ol>
      <p><span class="paragraphtext">You're much better off to <u>recycle your 
        old halogen torchiere</u> and purchase a new <u>E<span class="drops">NERGY</span> 
        S<span class="drops">TAR</span> torchiere</u> from LightSite or your local 
        retail store. The money you save in replacement bulbs and energy bills 
        will normally pay for the extra cost in 9 months to a year and a half.</span></p>
      <p><i class="paragraphtextwhite"><span class="paragraphtitle">Q:</span> 
        I thought halogen bulbs were supposed to be a little more energy efficient 
        than incandescent. How come halogen torchieres are such energy wasters?</i></p>
      <p><span class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtitle">A: </span>Good 
        question. As we mentioned in <u>the history of lighting</u>, halogen bulbs 
        usually improve energy efficiency and lifetime a little. The halogen gas 
        inside snatches up tungsten atoms that have boiled off of the filament 
        and re-deposits them back on the filament. This allows the filament to 
        run at higher temperatures than it otherwise would, without causing the 
        lamp to fail quickly. Higher filament temperatures normally increase energy 
        efficiency, though they obviously pose a greater safety risk as well.</span></p>
      <p><span class="paragraphtext">In fact, if you buy a halogen bulb from one 
        of the major domestic manufacturers (GE, Osram/Sylvania, or Philips), 
        it should provide a few more lumens per watt than a normal incandescent 
        bulb. But these fancy halogen bulbs are rarely sold with halogen torchieres. 
        They usually cost about twice as much as generic replacement bulbs, so 
        many people have never used one. And be careful: these bulbs may be your 
        brightest option for a halogen torchiere, but are often the hottest as 
        well.</span></p>

            significantly lower efficiency and less light than they are rated

        a small amount of light right where it is needed and don't take up a lot 
        of space to do it. Many desk lights use 20 watt halogen bulbs in very 
        slender, elegant fittings to help you read or do fine work. Halogen is 
        a great choice in this application, because fluorescent and normal incandescent 
        fixtures would be much bulkier and could not aim the light as precisely.</span></p>
      <p><span class="paragraphtext">By contrast, torchieres are a terrible application 
        for halogen bulbs. They are used for general room lighting and scatter 
        their light very broadly. Also they require enormous amounts of light 
        output to give you enough illumination down at eye level to read or work 
        by. There are three reasons for this. First, more than 10% of the light 
        gets absorbed immediately in the fixture. Second, much of the light is 
        absorbed in the ceiling or walls, and never reflected back to you. Third, 
        the light has to travel much farther to get from the top of the fixture 
        to the ceiling and back down to you than if it could just shine directly 
        toward you (like a shaded table or floor lamp).</span></p>
      <p><span class="paragraphtext">Because light intensity diminishes by the 
        square of the distance it travels, that third factor makes a huge difference. 
        Suppose the light from a desk lamp only travels 2 feet to reach you, but 
        the light from a torchiere must travel a total of 8 feet (3 feet up to 
        the ceiling and 5 feet back down) to reach you. To get the same amount 
        of light, the torchiere needs to be not just 4 times (8 feet / 2 feet) 
        as bright, but at least 16 times (42) as bright.</span></p>
      <p><span class="paragraphtext">To borrow a phrase from our <u>technical 
        aspects of lighting</u> section, use low wattage halogen bulbs for certain 
        task and accent lighting applications. You should almost never use halogen 
        bulbs for general or ambient lighting. For tasks where you need a broad 
        area illuminated, like work benches or kitchen countertops, halogen lighting 
        is also a bad idea. Linear fluorescent lamps work much better, because 
        they provide a very even, continuous light output and can be hidden easily 
        behind molding strips so they don't shine directly in your eyes.</span></p>
      <p><i class="paragraphtextwhite"><span class="paragraphtitle">Q: </span>I 
        keep hearing about full spectrum or natural spectrum lighting. Is it really 
        better for you than other kinds of artificial lighting?</i></p>
      <p><span class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtitle">A:</span> That's 
        a tough one. First we should define full spectrum lighting. Take a look 
        at these three charts. As you can see, sunlight includes relatively even 
        amounts of red, green and blue light. Typical incandescent bulbs provide 
        a bit of overkill with the reds, a moderate amount of greens, and not 
        enough blue. Typical fluorescent bulbs are heavily concentrated in the 
        greens and blues, but weaker in the reds. Full spectrum lamps attempt 
        to mimic the distribution of light output in sunlight. They can be either 
        incandescent or fluorescent, though the incandescent variety is much more 
        commonly available.</span></p>
      <p><span class="paragraphtext">As we noted in our earlier section on <u>incandescent, 
        halogen, and compact fluorescent bulbs</u>, full spectrum bulbs are very 
        expensive and appear to be even less energy efficient than typical incandescent 
        bulbs. They seem to include a coating that blocks some of the light the 
        bulb would normally produce, which shifts the balance of its colors but 
        reduces efficiency.</span></p>
      <p><span class="paragraphtext">There is some evidence that full spectrum 
        bulbs can help prevent Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) if used at very 
        high lighting levels, but many of the products on the market do not provide 
        anywhere near that much light. In fact, the special light boxes that doctors 
        prescribe for patients with SAD provide about 8 to 20 times as much light 
        as typical indoor levels. The evidence to support other claims about effects 
        on mood and productivity is far more mixed. For the full scoop, check 
        out this website: <u>link to IRC report</u>.</span></p>
      <p><i class="paragraphtextwhite"><span class="paragraphtitle">Q: </span>Is 
        fluorescent lighting bad for you? I've heard it causes cancer.</i></p>
      <p><span class="paragraphtext"><span class="paragraphtitle">A: </span>This 
        is one of those rumors that refuses to go away, and gets passed around 
        like the urban legend about the woman who tried to dry her pet in the 
        microwave (bad idea). There is no evidence to suggest that fluorescent 
        lighting causes cancer.</span></p>
      <p><span class="paragraphtext">We do know that ultraviolet (UV) light can 
        cause skin cancer, but sunlight contains about 100 to 1,000 times as much 
        UV light as typical indoor lighting. Halogen and metal halide (HID) light 
        sources generally produce the most UV of typical lighting products. Compact 
        fluorescent and incandescent bulbs each produce a much lower amount of 
        UV light, which can be even further reduced by various types of lenses 
        and diffusers on your light fixtures.</span></p>
      <p><span class="paragraphtext">We do know that high quality, modern fluorescent 
        lighting is better for your health and productivity than older fluorescent 
        lighting. The newest products switch on and off extremely rapidly, which 
        greatly reduces the chances that people working under the light will suffer 
        headaches or eyestrain from buzz or flicker. In fact, in some locations 
        where workers are doing data entry or sorting mail, tests have shown that 
        super-efficient lighting in well-designed fixtures can improve productivity 
        enough to pay for itself, without even counting the energy savings.</span></p>
