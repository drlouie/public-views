              <br>
              <span class="paragraphtext"> The original idea for LightSite came 
              from Chris Calwell, one of the founders of Ecos Consulting and a 
              leader in efforts over the last decade to improve residential lighting 
              energy efficiency. The Ecos Consulting team now manages energy-saving 
              residential lighting programs on behalf of utilities in six states. 
              Ecos established a partnership with Energy Federation Inc., one 
              of the nation's largest and best-known fulfillment houses for energy 
              saving products, to bring LightSite to market in 1998.</span></p>
            <p class="paragraphtext">We hope that LightSite is useful to you and 
              welcome your comments and suggestions. If you have a question for 
              Chris or the rest of the LightSite team, please email us. We'll

        </span><span class="paragraphtitleblue">Chris Calwell<br>
        </span><span class="paragraphtext">Chris Calwell built the first compact 
        fluorescent torchiere prototype in 1994, and has been working to solve 
        the halogen torchiere problem ever since. He serves as the President of 
        Ecos Consulting, where he supervises research on residential lighting, 
        jointly manages LightSite with Mark Newton, writes about various environmental 
        topics, and takes a month off each year to teach college courses about 
        energy and ecology. Chris also works as a freelance environmental photographer, 
        plays racquetball, and tinkers with his passive solar home in Durango, 
        CO in his (increasingly infrequent) spare time.</span></p>
      <p class="paragraphtitleblue">Mark Newton<br>
        <span class="paragraphtext"> Mark Newton works on marketing and management 
        issues related to the LightSite as part of the Ecos Consulting team. Mark 
        is excited to help develop and manage profitable programs for companies 
        and consumers that solve energy efficiency and environmental challenges. 
        When he isn't working, Mark enjoys mountain biking, road riding, cross 
        riding and snowboarding. Feel free to drop him an e-line if you have questions 
        about the site, feedback and suggestions, or if you just want to will 
        your estate over to him.</span></p>
