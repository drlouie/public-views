        S<span class="drops">TAR</span>®</span> residential light fixture program 
        began in March of 1997. These fixtures do not use a standard threaded 
        socket for light bulbs, but instead include a built-in ballast, which 
        is an electronic circuit that operates a matching fluorescent lamp. All 
        light fixtures bearing the <span class="paragraphtext">E<span class="drops">NERGY</span> 
        S<span class="drops">TAR</span>®</span> label meet strict federal specifications

        S<span class="drops">TAR</span>®</span> torchieres solve the safety problem 
        of halogen torchieres right at its source--with compact fluorescent lighting 
        technology. Using only 50 to 80 watts, they provide a similar amount of 
        crisp, white light as a 300-watt halogen model. They're safer precisely 
        because they don't waste energy creating so much heat.<br>

      <p class="paragraphtext">Best of all, <span class="paragraphtext">E<span class="drops">NERGY</span> 
        S<span class="drops">TAR</span>®</span> labeled torchieres are great for 
        the environment--by using less energy, they reduce air pollution from 
        power plants. In fact, you'd have to cut your driving by about 500 miles 
        each year in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions as much as one <span class="paragraphtext">E<span class="drops">NERGY</span> 
        S<span class="drops">TAR</span>®</span> labeled torchiere can.</p>
      <p class="paragraphtext">Last but not least, they're convenient. Their super-efficient 
        bulbs only need to be replaced every four to eight years. You don't need 
        to handle them with gloves. You don't need to wipe off your fingerprints 
        with alcohol. You don't need to find a screwdriver to install a glass 
        cover over them to protect yourself from ultraviolet radiation and shattered 
        bulb fragments. And they don't need an ugly metal cage to keep the bulb 
        away from flammable materials. Does that sound better than halogen? It 
        is!</p>

        ENERGY STAR(r) Labeled Torchieres</span><br>
        </span> Today, at least five companies offer torchieres qualifying for 
        the <span class="paragraphtext">E<span class="drops">NERGY</span> S<span class="drops">TAR</span>®</span> 
        label. These fixtures plug into any household outlet. They come with two-way 
        or three-way switches, or, in some cases, full-range dimmers--just like 
        halogen models. Most E<span class="drops">NERGY</span> S<span class="drops">TAR</span><b>®</b> 
        torchieres are similar in size and shape to halogens as well, and come 
        in a range of colors and finishes. They also come with a warranty of at 
        least two years, which is longer than the warranty most manufacturers 
        offer on portable light fixtures. </p>
