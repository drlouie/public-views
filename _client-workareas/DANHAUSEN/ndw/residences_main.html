                        and at ease.<br>

                        since we opened our doors, NDFW has expanded from a 15-bed 
                        to a 30-bed highly structured residential facility. Located 
                        in Costa Mesa, near Newport Beach's Back Bay and the Nature 
                        Preserve, NDFW's facilities include the primary residential 
                        center Founders' House, where the women prepare and eat 
                        their meals, attend counseling sessions, participate in 
                        a number of therapeutic activities, and reside (three 
                        women to each bedroom). Founders' House is also the location 
                        for our medical and assessment facilities.<br>

                        treatment may then move into one of our two residential 
                        cottages: Phister and Courage. Each residential cottage 
                        includes two bedrooms (two beds per room), a full kitchen, 
                        as well as dining and living areas. All of our residential 
                        areas have been recently refurbished and repainted, and 
                        provide private, welcoming environments for women undergoing 
                        their recovery.<br>

                        staff and functions are located in our Faith House, while

                        and our newly acquired Elliot House. We invite potential 
                        residents and supporters alike to schedule an appointment 
                        with one of our staff members for a tour of our residential
