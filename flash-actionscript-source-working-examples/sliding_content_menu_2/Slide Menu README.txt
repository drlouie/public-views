Slide Menu .FLA fileCreated in: Flash4Original Design by: www.deconcept.com (It was his idea, and I got it right here on Flashkit!)Modified Design by: Yael Weiss of www.digitalmineral.com (as of this writing, the hosting company is still giving me a hard time. Placeholder page is at: www.geocities.com/digitalmineral2000/trial.htm)The link buttons don't work, meaning, they don't go to the correct page yet. Otherwise, the hyperlink buttons (for websites) do work.  To see the original design, visit www.deconcept.com and email him, or just browse around on the site. If you email Deconcept, please give him the credit!Good luck!A couple 'thoughts aloud'..."It's easier to modify an .fla than make one up. It's easier to improve upon an idea than be original. The best ideas are built on good ideas - - but are just a little bit better. There's nothing new under the sun.- think about it, you'll see it's really true.""I'm not a Flash expert, I'm a Beginner that doesn't have enough time to spend hours on end doing Flash (and thus graduate to 'Intermediate'). How is it that so many great designers are also programmers?? Where did they learn ActionScript (how did they have time/patience)? If you are one of those who can do both, please teach me a trick or two (and if you send in a tutorial to Flashkit, remember: you're talking to designers).""The name 'Yael' is a girl name, and it's Hebrew (in case you were trying to figure that out)."Any questions: write to digitalmineral@excite.comEnjoy Flash!  And thank you for downloading!
