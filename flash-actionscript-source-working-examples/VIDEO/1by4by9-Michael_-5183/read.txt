Welcome to another open source movie.

This movie is a basic navigation system where the user can fill in the blanks and just
mess around with it a bit.

The movie start as a rip off of an open source by  http://www.designstrategy.gq.nu 
available on flashkit at http://www.flashkit.com/movies/Interfaces/Sites/designst-designst-5172/index.shtml

I downloaded the movie because I liked the music, to my surprise the music wasn't in the source code,
so just for fun I thought to see if I could improve on the movie that they created.  

In the end there is only the navigation buttons left from the original movie and even those are modified a little.  

This movie took me about eight hours to create (including the video editing), which is quite long for me because I usually lose interest after
about an hour.    It still needs a good preloader and a scroll bar added to it, so if anyone want's to do that go ahead and upload it again.

It also looks very similar to my other open source movie on flashkit called microbes 
http://www.flashkit.com/movies/Interfaces/Other/Microbes-Michael_-3908/index.shtml 

I just couldn't help it.

Anyway I welcome any feedback since the only email I get is spam.

Take Care.
Mike
