windowtitel=Window 1
&window1text=The only thing which i have not been able to make more automatic is the size of the window. It is not too difficult to change manualy however. If you open MC text1 there you can change any sizes you want. However, to change the text-scroller-height you will need to change the following variable in frame 4 or MC text1:
Set Variable: "balkheight" = "80"
and you will have to change the underlying bar (graphic: bar) in the 3 frames of MC scrollbar manualy. Be carefull not to change te size of the scroll-button (MC scroll drag mc) here. Also correct the inicial possition of the scroll button here (set it to bottom, the effect will be "mirrored" in result)
To see a more advance variation, download http://orbita.starmedia.com/~pjv/files/multi-windows-inc.exe for a demo. This file will be sent on request only (to keep some of the direct competition behind ;-)
