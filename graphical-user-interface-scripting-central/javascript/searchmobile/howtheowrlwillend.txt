How the World will End

It is believed by some religions the world will end tragically,
Though this is not far from my beliefs on the issue.
Yet, I don't believe human kind will parish for eternity,
I believe it will be more like humans spreading through the universe.

Yes the world might burn up and the stars will fall,
For well see some asteroids coming quite close to earth
And we also tend to be disrupting the Ozone
Which in turn will soon destory our weather

But haven't we known this for a while
Are we not preparing for this coming on the earth
I belive we are, yet we must start to work to a better beat
A beat that not only puts us in space withing decades

Yet, a beat so loud it brings our world together as one power
A central system from the far reaches of the Milky Way
Human kind we shall call ourselves with confidence
We do tend to be the smartest creature in our times

At the same time we are equally destructive in our ways
Order must come from within our people, all people on earth
Centralize the Law of the land for contiuous peace
Localize space development systems to make our resources abundant

And blast into space for it looks to be our only true destiny
