users only have a chance of seeing this page if the inspector's <font face="'Courier New',Courier,monospace">useRedirect</font> flag is set to true.

<br>
users that land here either don't have flash installed or have a browser that doesn't support plugin detection (such as ie4.5 and earlier on mac). for the latter group, we make sure to offer a <a href="movie.html">link to the flash content</a>.
