<p>HAMweather needs to be able to connect to the NWS servers so that it can get the latest
weather information.&nbsp; When HAMweather is used on an intranet you may need to perform
this connection using a proxy server.&nbsp; HAMweather now has basic proxy server support.
&nbsp; You can set the proxy servers name (or IP address) and port it is listening on.
&nbsp; However, HAMweather does not support proxy servers that require a username/password
authorization.</p>

  </tr>

<p>To set up the proxy server settings, goto the web based admin, click the 'System
Settings' link.&nbsp; Then you can enter the proxy server address or IP.&nbsp; It may look
similiar to: proxy.your domain.com.</p>

<p>Under this setting you can set the proxy port number.&nbsp; This is the port number
that your proxy server is listening on.&nbsp; This is usually something similiar to '80'
or '8080'.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Note: If you do not have a proxy server you should&nbsp; set the port number to '80';</p>

<p>Alternatively if you do not want ot use the web based admin you can make a couple
modifications to the hwconfig.txt file.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In this file look for the lines that looks similar to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$proxy_server = '';<br>
  $port = 80;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the $proxy_server variable is left blank then HAMweather will not use a proxy
server, but if set to either the proxy server name or IP address it will then use the
proxy server when fetching the weather data. The $port variable is used to set the port
that the proxy server is listening on.</p>

<p>To set up HAMweather to work with a proxy server at proxy.yourdomain.com that is
listenign on port 80 then you would use the following settings:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$proxy_server = 'proxy.yourdomain.com';<br>
  $port = 80;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another example would be to set HAMweather to use a proxy at the IP addres
123.123.123.123 listening on port 8080 you would use the following settings:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$proxy_server = '123.123.123.123;<br>
  $port = 8080;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you need to stop using proxy support simply set $proxy_server to a blank string as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$proxy_server = '';<br>
  $port = 80;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
