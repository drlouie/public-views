<p><big><big><font color="#000080">Trouble Shooting Server Errors</font></big></big></p>

<p>If you get a <strong>500 Error (Internal Server Error)</strong>, then one of the
following is likely the problem: 

<ul>
  <li>The path to Perl is wrong.&nbsp; you may consult your ISP's documentation, contact your
    system administrator or try <strong>/usr/bin/perl, /usr/local/bin/perl, /usr/bin/perl5 or
    /usr/local/bin/perl5.</strong></li>
  <li>You did not transfer the script in ASCII mode.&nbsp; Do this and transfer the file
    again.</li>
  <li>You did not set the permissions on the file to executable as describe in step 2.</li>
  <li>The file path you provided in step 3 (namely the path for <strong><font color="#000080">$hw_cgi_dir_url</font></strong>)
    may be incorrect.&nbsp; Double check tomake sure this path is correct.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you get a <strong>404 Error (File Not Found)</strong>, then the URL that you entered
does not correspond to the location where you put the hw2test.cgi script in step 2. &nbsp;
You should double check the URL even the spleen and capitalization of the URL.</p>

<p>If you get a<strong> 403 Error (Forbidden)</strong>, then you most likely forgot to
change the permissions to 0755(executable) or you did not put the script in a directory
with the appropriate CGI permissions.</p>

<p>If you see the <strong>source code of the script and not an information page</strong>,
then either the extension that you gave the script is incorrect (if you tried
&quot;.cgi&quot; try &quot;.pl&quot; instead), or you did not put the script in a
directory with appropriate CGI permissions.</p>

<p><big><big><font color="#000080">Trouble Shooting Other Errors</font></big></big></p>

<p>So you didn't get a common server type error, so now whats the problem?</p>

<p><big><strong>Cannot Connect to the IWIN and/or NWS servers error</strong> </big>

<ul>
  <li>The National Weather service or IWIN server is down. This happens sometimes but is not
    often.&nbsp; You can double check the HAMweather site to see if the main HAMweather demo
    is working. If it is then this most likely is not the problem.</li>
  <li>If you are getting this error only and you are using the sockets http_mode (the default)
    to connect to the Weather servers&nbsp; you may try using the LWP mode.&nbsp; Simply goto
    the web based admin, click the system settings link and you can select the select the
    LWP::Simple or LWP advanced mode for HTTP mode. Alternatively, you can open up the
    hwconfig.txt file and set the $http_mode variable to 1 thus it would look like: <strong><font
    color="#FF0000">NOTE</font></strong>:&nbsp; <strong><font color="#FF0000">This mode
    requires that you have the LWP Modules installed.</font></strong><br>
    <font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>$http_mode =1;</strong></font></li>
</ul>

<p><big><strong>Fetching page error : -hwERR Can't connect socket:Unknown error </strong></big>or<br>
<big><strong>-hwERR Can't connect socket:Address family not supported by protocol family</strong></big>

<ul>
  <li>These error are most likely caused if your servers setup will not allow the sockets
    http_mode (the default) to connect to the weather servers.&nbsp; In this case you will
    need to use the LWP http_mode.&nbsp; This requires that you have the LWP modules install
    on you server. (You can test for them using the Pre-Install Setup Program) If the LWP
    modules are installed then goto the web based admin, click the system settings link and
    you can select the select the LWP::Simple or LWP advanced mode for HTTP mode.
    Alternatively, you can open up the hwconfig.txt file and set the $http_mode variable to 1
    thus it would look like: <strong><font color="#FF0000">NOTE</font></strong>:&nbsp; <strong><font
    color="#FF0000">This mode requires that you have the LWP Modules installed.</font></strong><br>
    <font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>$http_mode =1;</strong></font></li>
</ul>

<p><big><strong>Document Contains no Data (Netscape Users) or a Blank Screen (Internet
Explorer Users)</strong></big></p>

<p>This error happens when the HAMweather script outputs the appropriate headers and
nothing else.&nbsp; The normal reasons for failure are: 

<ul>
  <li>When Using HAMweather Pro the GD.pm module is not installed.&nbsp; When
    creating/updating the dynamic maps HAMweather uses the GD.pm module to create them. &nbsp;
    If this modules is not on the server the script will fail before it can output naything
    but the headers, thus causing this error.&nbsp; Test that you have the GD.pm module
    installed on your server using the pre-install test script (hw2test.cgi) included in the
    HAMweather package.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000"><strong>NOTE</strong>:&nbsp; If you have
    installed the GD.pm locally to your web site and not server wide then you will need to add
    the 'use lib' command near the top of the hamweather.cgi file to let hamweather know where
    the GD.pm module was installed.&nbsp; the 'use lib' line should look similiar to:</font><br>
    <font color="#000080">use lib '/path/to/the/local/GDpm_directory',
    '/path/to/the/local/GDpm_directory/arch';<br>
    </font></li>
  <li>When using HW Pro and GD.pm is installed then you may have HW configured to use the
    GD.pm incorrectly.&nbsp; If you are using GD.pm 1.19 or older you need to make sure HW is
    using GD.pm in GIF mode&nbsp; and if you are using GD.pm 1.20+ then you need to make sure
    HW is using GD.pm in PNG mode.&nbsp; You can check/set this setting by going to the web
    based admin, click on System settings and select the correct GD.pm version number next to
    the GD.pm Version setting.&nbsp; Alternatively you can open up the hwconfig.txt file and
    set the $gd_version variable to 0 for GD.pm 1.19 or older or set it to 1 for gd.pm 1.20
    and newer.&nbsp; If you do not know what version of GD.pm you have installed you can use
    the pre-install test script provided in the distribution to find out.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Permissions and/or filepaths couldbe incorrect.&nbsp; Double check these.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">Note</font></strong>: <font color="#FF0000">As of Version
2.0 Beta 2.03 HAMweather uses version checkig that should help in stopping a lot of the
Document Contains no Data (Netscape Users) or a Blank Screen (Internet Explorer Users)
error for if the GD.pm is not installed or the permissions to the needed library files or
incorrect an error will be displayed.</font></p>

<p><big><strong>Error loading files XXXXXX</strong></big> 

<ul>
  <li>This error is caused when HAMweather tries loading a library file that does not exist.
    It is usually followed by a more detailed error message that will provide more insight
    into the failure.</li>
  <li>This error can occur if HAMweather tries to load a library file that is older than the
    one required.&nbsp; If this is so you will see an erro discripting labeling what file the
    error was with witht he current files version number and the needed version number. &nbsp;
    Make sure you have the latest versions of the HAMweather files.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><big><big><strong><font color="#000080">HAMweather Debug Mode</font></strong></big></big></p>

<p>HAMweather contains a debug mode that will give you information about your server,
parameters passed to HAMweather and other pertinent HAMweather information.&nbsp; To use
this mode simply browse to the hamweather.cgi filr and pass the debug=1 parameter. &nbsp;
The URL would look similiar to the following URLs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#000080"><em>http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/hamweather/hamweather.cgi?debug=1
  <br>
  http://www.yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/hamweather/hamweather.cgi?forecast=zandh&amp;place=blacksburg&amp;state=va&amp;debug=1</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you access the debug mode of HAMweather you will see the perl environmental
variables, the passed parameters, versions of HAMweather and all loaded hamweather library
files and other pertinent information.&nbsp; If for some reason you do not see this
information then the Debug ability may have been turned off. You can turn debug mode
capability on by going tothe web based admin, clicking the system settings link, and then
selected the &quot;On with 'debug=1' paramter&quot; or &quot;Always On&quot; options next
to the 'Debug mode&quot; setting.&nbsp; Alternatively, in the hwconfig.txt file there is a
variable named $allow_debug.&nbsp; This variable should be set to 0 to turn on debug
ability or 1 to turn off.&nbsp; Changing that line the hwconfig.txt file to the following
would turn debug ability on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$allow_debug = 0;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This debug information maybe useful in solving your HAMweather problems.&nbsp; When you
are done debugging if youwant to turn the debug ability off simply change the $allow_debug
value to '1' in the hwconfig.txt file.</p>
