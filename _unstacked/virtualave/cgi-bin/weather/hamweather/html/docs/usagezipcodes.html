<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>NOTE</strong></font>: The HWzipcode add-on is available
that will allow most zipcodes to be used to fetch forecasts for the US.&nbsp; It can be
downloaded from <a href="http://www.hamweather.com/downloads/">http://www.hamweather.com/downloads/</a>
&nbsp; </p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>NOTE</strong></font>: <font color="#000000">As of HW
2.035, HAMweather can support international zipcode files. This can&nbsp; allow a person
to enter a zipcode for a country and have the current conditions displayed. Currently
HAMweather only has the one US zipcode database available but you are free to further
create your own for international countries.&nbsp; The setup and usage of these is the
same as for US usage, with any differences noted through out. </font></p>

<p><big><strong><font color="#000080">Configuration</font></strong></big></p>

<p>Since there is no web based administration yet for zipcode database files you will have
to do this the hard way.&nbsp; Actually its not too hard, you will simply need to create
and/or edit a few text files.&nbsp; You create a separate text files for each state, thus
allowing for different associations in the different states.&nbsp; The naming convention
for the text files is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>XX.txt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where XX is the first two characters of the zipcode. For example, the zipcode database
file name that would contain the zipcode 24060 would be named 24.txt and would hold the
informaiton for all zipcodes between 24000 and 24999.</p>

<p>Again the US zipcode DB has already been created by HAMweather, LLC and if available
for download at: <a href="http://www.hamweather.com/downloads/">http://www.hamweather.com/downloads/</a>
&nbsp; </p>

<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">INTERNATIONAL USAGE NOTE:</font></strong>&nbsp; For non
US altplace files the naming convention is ZZ-XX.txt where ZZ is the countries two letter
abbreviation and XX is the first two characters of the zipcodes in that file. For example
for the Italian zipcode 00139, the zipcode database file which held this would be titled
it-00.txt and woudl hold the info on all italian zipcodes between 00000 to 00999.
&nbsp; HAMweather can support zipcodes that have characters besdies just numberas as well.
Everythign works the same except if your zipcode has spaces when you input the information
in the files you leave out the spaces. (the end user can still put i nthe spaces, for
HAMweather will take care of this.)</p>

<p><strong><big><font color="#000080">Zipcode Associations</font></big></strong></p>

<p>In each zipcode Database file you will have a separate line for each zipcode. Each line
will contain, the zipcode, the actual city and the actual state. HAMweather will then look
up this actual city, state combination in the altplace files. So be aware that there must
be an entry in the altplace files for the place you enter in the zipcode DB. (the
exception to this is the US zipcode DB)</p>
