The time has come to make a choice as a competitive company. Are you going to follow your competitors into the Internet realm or should you just sit, wait and hope your business does well without it? Well we all know what the answer will be to that question. 
<br><br>
Now another question... How the hell do you get your business on the Internet without spending all of last year's profits? Well, you can always purchase yourself a pre-made website for a few thousand dollars and hope it does as good as the competitor's site. Just as well as you can put water in your gas tank and drive to the market. Not too realistic is it?</td>
