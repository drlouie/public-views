Flourishing Thoughts From The Mind

Suddenly I feel a breeze slowly climbing through my window
Gasping for air I contemplate upon my thought of life.
The twists and turns that make up my every living second
Never do they openly provide a clear direction for my future.

I openly express my feelings of my mentally disfunctional being
Yet most people will just shine it on as a natural part of life.
Through many an enormous obstacle my life has muscled past
As I wish the days I drop in my path were a little simpler.

Unbearable the thought of my being becomes before my eyes
Flattering myself with my mental abilities and the rewards they acquire.
Not to the point where I speak of my abilities to the public
More in terms of self recognition and praise for my struggles.

On second thought I find that my life runs evenly proportioned 
From hardship to happiness it tends to lighten up at the end of the tunnel.
With a hard fight I get many a compliments and a heapful of reward
College is not a factor in this yet mind, body and soul were to thank.

Wreckless I drive my lifelong vehicle as I veer through the corners and rev on the straight
Using my everevolving mental abilities to get me through the lonesome day.
Images of the beach run along my mind as I keep my contemplation going
The sand under my feet and the skylight bright thanks to the lunar light.

Happiness flows through my mind on some yet sparse occasions
Quickly followed by the a fearful screech as life brings me right down to reality.
In reality people say that I look like a boy and I talk like a man
Funny I say, "Young my body will stay and wise my mind will grow."

Never a dull moment my life attains as it glances upon the next day of progress
