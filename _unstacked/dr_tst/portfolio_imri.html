IMRI needed a technically savvy way of presenting their corporate idea to the public on the net. All the content within the site is very simple and the layout for it is basic. Even though the content is basic, the site's front-end programming is anything but basic. Cross-Browser DHTML menus were added to the site's navigation to give the site a bit of a flair. The site's content flow is fully resizable depending on the viewing screen's resolution.
