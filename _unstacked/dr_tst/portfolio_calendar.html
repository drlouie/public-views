Originally planned as a project for online sample purposes, the Interactive Calendar quickly became a necessity after having been used here at HapaSol. We quickly adpated to its functionality, felxibility and accessibility that we even forgot it was just a sample piece. The original shell for the calendar's funationality was built by Matt Kruse, who is one of the best Perl/CGI coders the net has ever known. Here at HapaSol, the Calendar was added the ability to send a specific Day Schedule to any given email recipientdirectly for the site itself. Therefore opening new avenues for the script to take within a company's communication needs.
