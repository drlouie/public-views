B2B (Business-to-Customer) and B2C (Business-to-Business) sites play a major role within the Internet business world. Your Internet site must have a site that is able to communicate and clearly define your company's ideas and/or services in a user-friendly and eye-catching manner. We have found that the two main reasons why a user leaves a site quickly is simply because the site lacks either content or has troublesome navigation. We must keep in mind that many users are new to the Internet and even a higher percentage of users have been online for at least 2 years. So as a business site is being planned and structured, the main key would be to keep the variation of our target audiences at hand in order to mold a site that can be easily used by almost any user on any given operating system.
