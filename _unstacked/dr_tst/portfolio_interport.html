Our Interactive Portfolio consists of various projects we have successfully completed before and after HapaSol was formed. Here you can see some of the technological and creative abilities our group has to offer your company. Leave it to us, the masters of Internet creativity, to develop the best content available on the World Wide Web today. Our projects contain a variation of technologies such as HTML, CSS, DHTML, Flash, CGI, Perl, ASP, XML, Streaming Media and DOM. You will clearly see the differences between technologies and maybe you will also get some quick ideas for your own company's site. We have added the ability to let you comment on our work as you review it. This helps us in finding the best and worst pieces of our work so we can either remove or improve the look and feel for the next time you visit our clients' site and/or our site.
