<p>Well you have just downloaded HAMweather 2.0&nbsp; and now are getting ready for the
fun filled installation.&nbsp; The process isn't too bad, but if you do not have
experience setting up CGI scripts or just do not have the time you may want to check out
HAMweather, LLC's <a href="http://www.hamweather.com/install/">HAMweather Installation
Services</a>.&nbsp; Before installing you should use the HAMweather <a
href="http://www.hamweather.com/install/hw2testscript.html">Pre-install Test script</a> to
ensure that you will be able to run HAMweather on your server.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">NOTE</font></strong>: To add US zipcode searching
capability you will need to also download the HWzipdb add-on and install it per its
instructions. It is also recommended to install the HWaltplaces add-on. This add on will
allow for more US &quot;place, state&quot; combinations than normally available in
HAMweather. Both of these add-ons&nbsp; can be downloaded from <a
href="http://www.hamweather.com/downloads">http://www.hamweather.com/downloads</a> </p>

<p>HAMweather requires that your web site pass the following minimum requirements before
you will be able to use the HAMweather scripts: <br>
<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><strong>NOTE</strong></font>:&nbsp; With HAMweather Version 2.0 Beta
1.05&nbsp; or later the LWP::Simple Module is no longer needed. 

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Account</strong></font>. You must have an account to store
    www pages on a Unix, Linux, Windows NT &nbsp; or Windows 95/98 web server. </li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>CGI Permission.</strong></font>&nbsp; You must have
    permission to run custom CGI scripts on your web server.Be aware that the majority of free
    web services do not allow this ability. (America Online, GeoCities and Tripod are such
    accounts that do not allow for custom CGI scripts) </li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Perl</strong></font>.&nbsp; Perl 5.004 or later must be
    installed on the web server.&nbsp; On Windows NT and 95/98 server we prefer <a
    href="http://www.activestate.com">ActiveState Perl</a> be installed. </li>
  <li><strong><font color="#000080">Perl Sockets Module</font></strong>. The perl Sockets
    module should beinstalled on the server, for this module allows HAMweather to fetch the
    forecasts from the NWS.&nbsp; This module is part of the perl distribution and is usually
    automatically installed, but this module may be missing on a few ISPs that do not install
    the full Perl distribution.&nbsp; (Or the LWP Modules can be used)</li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>Perl GD.pm Module. </strong></font>Users of the HW Pro
    must have the Perl GD.pm Module installed on the server before the additional features of
    HAMweather Pro will work.&nbsp; These features include the dynamic image generation for
    the US forecast, Current Conditions and warning maps.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000"><strong>NOTE</strong></font>:
    GIF support is in GD.pm 1.19 and earlier.&nbsp; PNG support only in GD.pm 1.20 through
    1.25. PNG and JPEG support in GD.pm 1.26.&nbsp; Unix users can download gd.pm from CPAN
    at: <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/by-module/GD/">http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/by-module/GD/</a>
    &nbsp; NT users should have your Provider install the module via the Perl package manager
    (PPM).</li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>File Permissions.</strong></font>&nbsp; On Unix servers,
    you will need to have the ability to set and change file permissions either through FTP or
    telnet.&nbsp; The need to set file permissions does not usually exist for Windows NT,
    95/98 web servers. </li>
  <li><font color="#000080"><strong>FTP Access.</strong></font>&nbsp; You will need to have
    FTP access to the web directories on your server.&nbsp; An account with Front Page only
    access does not count.&nbsp; Telnet access would be a plus, but is not needed.</li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>NOTE</strong></font>: If you are unsure if your web site
has the correct perl version and/or the needed modules then you use the <a
href="http://www.hamweather.com/support">HAMweather Pre-Installation test script</a> to
test your web site. </p>

<p>If your web site meets the above requirements then to fully install HAMweather 2.0
follow the next four easy steps. Following these steps should get a working version of
HAMweather on your web site.&nbsp; After the demo is working then you can use the
HAMweather web based administration to set and/or customize some of the various settings.</p>

    name="STEP 1">STEP 1</a> : Uncompressing the package.</strong></big></font></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The first step is to uncompress the software package.&nbsp; You can use&nbsp; <a
href="http://www.winzip.com/">Winzip</a> or something similar. Once unzipped you should
have a directory structure similar to the directory tree shown in <a
href="install3to4.html">Step 3</a>.</p>

    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#000080"><big><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Installation : <a
    name="STEP 2">STEP 2 </a>: Pre-Install Test</strong></font></big></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Before you begin installing HAMweather on your server you should use the pre-install
test script (hw2test.cgi) to test your server to make sure what version of HAMweather you
should use and how to set it up.</p>

<p><big><font color="#000080"><strong>Steps to perform the pre-install test:</strong></font></big></p>

<p><strong><font color="#000080"><big>Step 1. </big></font>Set Perl path in the
hw2test.cgi</strong></p>

<p>You will need to change the first line of the pre-install test script (hw2test.cgi) to
match the perl path for your server.&nbsp; This is usually something like: /usr/bin/perl
or /usr/local/bin/perl.&nbsp; After modifying the first line it should look similiar to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>#!/usr/bin/perl</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><big><font color="#000080">Step 2.</font></big>&nbsp; Upload the HAMweather
Pre-Install Test Script to your Server.</strong></p>

<p>You will now use your FTP client to transfer the hw2test.cgi file from your local
machine to your servers CGI-BIN directory (or equivalent) because it needs to be executed
as a cgi script (Preferably upload the script to the same directory that you are going to
put your HAMweather scripts in).&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure you transfer the hw2test.cgi file
in ASCII mode.</p>

<p>Next set the permissions on the&nbsp; hw2test.cgi file to 0755 (rwxr-xr-x).&nbsp; If
you are on an NT server you can most likely skip this step.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>NOTE</strong></font>:&nbsp; If your server requires an
extension other than &quot;.cgi&quot; for perl scripts, you will need to rename the
script.&nbsp; Calling it <em>hw2test.pl</em> or whatever the proper extensions is on your
server.&nbsp; You will find that the &quot;.cgi&quot; extension works on most systems.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#000080"><big>Step 3.</big></font> Access the Pre-Install Test
Script with your Browser</strong></p>

<p>View the output of the script in your web browser by entering the URL to the script in
your web browser.&nbsp; This URL will be determined by the directory to which you uploaded
the hw2test.cgi script and the URL may look similar to: <em>http://www.yourserver.com/cgi-bin/hamweather/hw2test.cgi</em>.</p>

<p>If successful you will be presented with&nbsp; a web page detailing the version of perl
on your system, what (if any) needed modules are available on your server.&nbsp; From this
information the test script will attempt to inform you of which version of HAMweather you
may use on your sever as is.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>NOTE</strong></font>: The HW2test.cgi script will test to
see if GD.pm,&nbsp; LWP modules and Socket.pm are&nbsp; available server wide.&nbsp; If
you have installed these modules locally (mainly GD.pm) in your server space then the
script may not find them.&nbsp; If you have installed them locally you can try adding the
&quot;<em>use lib 'path/to/local/directory/containing/the/modules';</em>&quot; line as the
second or third line of the script.&nbsp; Then try the accessing the script again, if the
modules are found this time, then you will need to add this line to the hamweather.cgi
file as well.</p>

<p><big><font color="#000080">Trouble Shooting The Pre-Install Test Script</font></big></p>

<p>If you get a <strong>500 Error (Internal Server Error)</strong>, then one of the
following is likely the problem: 

<ul>
  <li>The path to Perl is wrong.&nbsp; you may consult your ISP's documentation, contact your
    system administrator or try <strong>/usr/bin/perl, /usr/local/bin/perl, /usr/bin/perl5 or
    /usr/local/bin/perl5.</strong></li>
  <li>You did not transfer the script in ASCII mode.&nbsp; Do this and transfer the file
    again.</li>
  <li>You did not set the permissions on the file to executable as describe in step 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you get a <strong>404 Error (File Not Found)</strong>, then the URL that you entered
does not correspond to the location where you put the hw2test.cgi script in step 2. &nbsp;
You should double check the URL even the spleen and capitalization of the URL.</p>

<p>If you get a<strong> 403 Error (Forbidden)</strong>, then you most likely forgot to
change the permissions to 0755(executable) or you did not put the script in a directory
with the appropriate CGI permissions.</p>

<p>If you see the s<strong>ource code of the script and not an information page</strong>,
then either the extension that you gave the script is incorrect (if you tried
&quot;.cgi&quot; try &quot;.pl&quot; instead), or you did not put the script in a
directory with appropriate CGI permissions.</p>

</table>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>NOTE</strong>:&nbsp; Be on the look out for the upcoming
&nbsp; HAMweather Install Tool.&nbsp; It will help in the configuration of these setup
files.</font></p>

<p>With the software package uncompressed it is now time for the hardest step of the
installation process.&nbsp; Here you will need to set up the configuration files. &nbsp;
In particular the default.txt file located in the&nbsp; &quot;/users/&quot;
directory.&nbsp; Then you will need to edit the first 3 lines in CGI script files
themselves.</p>

<p>You will need to gather the following four pieces of information and add them to the
default.txt file in the user directory as stated::</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>You will now need the URL to the cgi directory above that holds the HAMweather scripts.<strong>
      <font color="#FF0000">For Example:</strong>&nbsp; If the URL to the HAMweather script on
      your system will be: <em>http://www.hamweather.com/cgi-bin/weather/hamweather.cgi</em>&nbsp;
      then you will need to know the </font><strong><font color="#000080"><em>http://www.hamweather.com/cgi-bin/weather</em></font></strong><font
      color="#FF0000"> portion.<br>
      <br>
      </font>You will use this information to set the $hw_cgi_dir_url variable in the
      default.txt file.&nbsp; The line will look similar <br>
      to:<br>
      <font color="#000080"><strong>$hw_cgi_dir_url =
      &quot;http://www.hamweather.com/cgi-bin/weather&quot;;<br>
      </strong></font></li>
    <li>You will now need the full path name to the directory where the HAMweather cgi scripts
      will be.&nbsp; This is not the URL and does not include<em> &quot;http://.&quot;</em> <font
      color="#FF0000"><strong>For Example:</strong> If the full path to the HAMweather html
      files directory on your system will be: &nbsp;
      /usr/www/users/hamnet/hamweather/hamweatherhtmlfiles.html&nbsp; then you will need to know
      the </font><font color="#000080">/<strong>usr/www/users/hamnet/hamweather/weather</strong></font><font
      color="#FF0000"> portion. </font><font color="#000000">(On Microsoft NT and W95/98
      platforms you will also need to include the drive letter.)<br>
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> This is not the path to the HAMweather HTML templates but to the
      html files that lead into HAMweather.&nbsp; The HAMweather &quot;images&quot; directory
      and all its subdirectories must be in this directory as well. For Example: the images path
      would be</font><font color="#FF0000"> </font><font color="#000080">/<strong>usr/www/users/hamnet/hamweather/weather/images</strong></font><font
      color="#000000">.<br>
      <br>
      You will use this information to set the </font>$hw_html_dir_path variable near the top of
      the default.txt file.&nbsp; The line will look similar to :<br>
      <font color="#000080"><strong>$hw_html_dir_path
      =&quot;/usr/www/users/hamnet/hamweather/weather&quot;;<br>
      </strong></font></li>
    <li>You will now need the URL to the cgi directory above that holds the HAMweather html
      files and images directory.<strong> <font color="#FF0000">For Example:</strong>&nbsp; If
      the URL to the HAMweather script on your system will be: <em>http://www.hamweather.com/</em>weather/hamweatherhtmlfiles.html

    <li>You will now need the URL to the HAMweather administration script<strong>. <font
      color="#FF0000">For Example:</strong>&nbsp; If the URL to the HAMweather administration
      script on your system will be: <em>http://www.hamweather.com/cgi-bin/weather/hwadmin5340/hwadmin.cgi</em>&nbsp;
      then you will need to know this.&nbsp; You sould change the 'hwadmin5340' portion to a
      different name for security reasons.&nbsp; You could change it to something similiar to: </font><strong><font
      color="#000080"><em>http://www.hamweather.com/cgi-bin/weather/hwadmin1256/hwadmin.cg</em>i</font></strong><font
      color="#FF0000"> or such.<br>
      <br>
      </font>You will use this information to set the $admin_script_url variable in the

      to:<br>
      <strong><font color="#000080">$admin_script_url = <a

      </font><font color="#FF0000">NOTE</font></strong><font color="#000080">: Technically you
      can leave this setting as &quot; hwadmin.cgi&quot; and it will usually work fine.<strong><br>
      </strong></font></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now you will need to gather two pieces of information and add this to the first couple
  lines of the following cgi scripts:</p>
  <table border="2" bordercolor="#000080" cellpadding="2" bordercolorlight="#000080"
  bordercolordark="#000080" cellspacing="0">

          <td height="21">In the admin directory of the HAMweather cgi path.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <ul>
    <li>You will need the path to perl on your on your system.&nbsp; This is usually something
      like: /usr/bin/perl or /usr/local/bin/perl.&nbsp; You will add this as the first line in
      the above cgi files. it will look as follows on:<br>
      <br>
      #!/usr/bin/perl<br>
    </li>
    <li>The full path name to the directory where the HAMweather cgi scripts will be.&nbsp; This
      is not the URL and does not include<em> &quot;http://.&quot;</em> <font color="#FF0000"><strong>For
      Example:</strong> If the full path to the HAMweather script on your system will be:&nbsp; <em>/usr/www/users/hamnet/hamweather/cgi-bin/weather/hamweather.cgi
      </em>then you will need to know the </font><font color="#000080"><strong><em>/usr/www/users/hamnet/hamweather/cgi-bin/weather</em></strong></font><font
      color="#FF0000"> portion. </font><font color="#000000">(On Microsoft NT and W95/98
      platforms you will also need to include the drive letter.)<br>
      <br>
      You will use this information to set the </font>$hw_cgi_dir_path variable near the top of
      the each of the cgi files (The second or third line from the top).&nbsp; The line will
      look similar to :<br>
      <font color="#000080"><strong>$hw_cgi_dir_path =
      &quot;/usr/www/users/hamnet/hamweather/cgi-bin/weather&quot;;</strong></font></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>You may find that you will need to change the http_mode.&nbsp; This is the way that
HAMweather connect to the Weather servers.&nbsp; Since a lot of servers do not have the
LWP modules installed the default is for HAMweather to use normal sockets. But on some
servers this will not work properly.&nbsp; If you find that you cannot connect&nbsp; (you
will recieve protocol errors) using the default sockets mode then you will need to have
the LWP modules installed and then you will need to set HAMweather&nbsp; to use the LWP
http_mode. </p>

<p>To switch to the LWP mode, browse to the web based administration (browse to the
administration URL you just previously entered into the users/default.txt file). Next
click on the &quot;System settings&quot; link and then you can set the http_mode.&nbsp; If
you are having trouble with with the web based admin you can&nbsp; simply open up the <em>hwconfig.txt</em>
file and set the $http_mode variable to 1 thus it would look like: <strong><font
color="#FF0000">NOTE</font></strong>: &nbsp; <strong><font color="#FF0000">This mode
requires that you have the LWP Modules installed.</font></strong><br>
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>$http_mode =1;</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>NOTE:&nbsp; Users of the HYPERMART free webservers should
use HAMweather in the LWP mode.</strong></font></p>
