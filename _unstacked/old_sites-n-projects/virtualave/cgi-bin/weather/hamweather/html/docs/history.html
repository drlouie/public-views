<p><font color="#000080"><strong>Changes since HAMweather 2.035</strong></font><ul>
      <li>Fixed bug with HAMweather displaying the noforecast.html<br>
        template twice when a forecast cannot be found.<br>
        (changed hamweather.cgi)</li>
      <li>Fixed a obscure bug that kept HAMweather from displaying a<br>
        zone forecast when a states zone numbers were intertwined with<br>
        another zone number group.<br>
        i.e. for the zone header of:<br>
        PAZ021-030-OHZ040-041-049-050-PAZ020-029-031-032-WVZ001&gt;003-<br>
        HAMweather would only check the first PA group (PAZ021-030) and not the<br>
        second PA group on the same line (PAZ020-029-031-032) thus incorrectly<br>
        saying that the forecast was unavailable.<br>
        This has now been corrected. (changed hamweatherlib.pl)</li>
      <li>Included new intzandh.html in all distributions and update file.</li>
    </ul>

<p><font color="#000080"><strong>Changes since HAMweather 2.0 Beta 3.1</strong></font>

<ul>
  <li>Added support for GD.pm 1.26 jpeg support (though to lack of not having<br>
    GD.pm 1.26 installed to test it is not totally guaranteed to work!)<br>
    Currently it fetches the png radar from hamweather opens it as a png but then<br>
    resaves it as a jpeg and works with it. When I am able to actually test GD.pm 1.26<br>
    and any chnages are needed I will release an update then.<br>
    (all the hwpro lib files chnaged)</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with HW not giving correct temps when they read similar ot:<br>
    &quot;Low in the mid to upper 50s except lower 60s near the coast.&quot;<br>
    (changed gamweatherlib.pl)</li>
  <li>Fixed bug that occured when day_begin was greater than the day_end</li>
  <li>Changed current.html to use the %%iconheight%% and<br>
    %%iconwidth%% properties instead of the hard coded numbers</li>
  <li>Canadian forecasts can now show current conditions<br>
    if they are available. when using the forecast parameter<br>
    forecast=zandh. This feature uses the metar obs and the new<br>
    canadial alt place files</li>
  <li>Added support for international zipcode capabilities<br>
    WH now has the ability to handle international zipcodes<br>
    NOTE: ONLY the US zipcod DB is available from HW, you will<br>
    need to create the zipcode dbs/altplace files for your country<br>
    FOr international zipcodes, they go in the 'zipcodes' folder<br>
    and use the naming convention:<br>
    xx-yy-##. where xx is the countries two letter abbrev and yy<br>
    is the state/provinces two letter abbrev. If your country does not have<br>
    states/provinces then use the countries two letter abbrev as both<br>
    xx and yy. ## are the first two characters of the zipcode in this file.<br>
    thus if you are searching for the zipcode 24060 this portion would be<br>
    24 and the file woudl hold all zipcodes from 24000 to 24999.<br>
    The particulars:<br>
    1) US zipcodes files use the naming convention yy-##.txt where the<br>
    yy is the state abbrev.<br>
    2) Each line in the zipcode file should have:<br>
    complete zipcode, place, state<br>
    example of the zipcode 24060 for balcksburg ,va would be<br>
    24060,blacksburg,va<br>
    If your country does not have states/provinces then you should use<br>
    the countries two letter abbrev as the state<br>
    thus for Roma Italy (zipcode 00139) you would use<br>
    00139,Roma,IT<br>
    3) You must then add the place to the altplace file for this country<br>
    so that HW can find out what info to display for this place.<br>
    4) The new International zipcode support can handle zipcodes that<br>
    use both numbers and letters.<br>
    5) If the zipcode entered uses spaces (i.e Canada) HW will strip the<br>
    spaces out. and the zipcode that is in the zipcode db file must be the<br>
    zipcode with the spaces stripped<br>
    6) If using zipcodes that are both letters and numbers they can only be<br>
    entered into the zipcode parameter. A zipcode that is only numbers can be<br>
    entered into the zipcode parameter or the pands parameter</li>
  <li>Added support for allowing a user to input<br>
    &quot;place, state/province, country&quot;<br>
    This has a few particulars:<br>
    1) If your country does not have states/provinces then<br>
    this does not work for you. You should use a seperate<br>
    form with a hidden field setting country to match yours.<br>
    2) The countries altplace files must be saved as<br>
    xx-yy-altplaces.txt (where xx is the countries 2 letter abbrev,<br>
    yy is the state/province). US does not need use the xx- portions<br>
    3) if country portion is missing US is assumed.<br>
    4) Country portion must be the two letter abbreviation:<br>
    (Exception of canada which can enter 'ca' or 'canada')<br>
    5)Canada is set up to go with this feature. You can expand on the<br>
    canadian altplace files :)<br>
    (changed hw2lib.pl)</li>
  <li>Created canadian altplace files. They are labeled<br>
    ca-xx-altplaces.txt where the xx is the provinces two<br>
    letter abbrev. Note that canadian altplace files<br>
    have one difference. In the alternate zone place you<br>
    put in the file to fetch the forecast from followed by &quot;--&quot;<br>
    then the actual text to search for it different from the<br>
    requested name. (see files for example)</li>
  <li>Changed the canadaian DB files. they are now altplace<br>
    files. they now use the provinces two letter abbreviation</li>
  <li>Added support for international associated city files.<br>
    (this is where a person simply enters a city name into<br>
    the search box with no state or country setting). The main<br>
    city-all.txt supports a country filed which will work in conjunction<br>
    of the international altplace files.) Also individual countries<br>
    can have their own xx-city-all.txt where xx is the countries two<br>
    letter abbreviation.<br>
    (changed hw2lib.pl)</li>
  <li>Added support for international altplace files<br>
    They work the same as US altplace files except only US<br>
    and Canada can give forecasts, but the international altplace<br>
    files can be set up to give the current conditions using the ICAO<br>
    identifier. international altplace files use the naming convention:<br>
    xx-yy-altplaces. where xx is the countries two letter abbrev and yy<br>
    is the state/provinces two letter abbrev. If your country does not have<br>
    states/provinces then use the countries two letter abbrev as both<br>
    xx and yy.<br>
    Take note that if the city may be spelled differently by different users you<br>
    should add all spellings to the file. FOr example for Venezia it maybe<br>
    spelled as Venezia or as Venice. You would add both combinations to<br>
    the altplace file thus giving 2 lines such as<br>
    venezia=Venezia / Tessera|0|LIPZ|2<br>
    venice=Venezia / Tessera|0|LIPZ|3<br>
    (changed hw2lib.pl)</li>
  <li>HW now only uses the zipcode,place, state from the zipcode<br>
    database then does a look up in the altplace files for rest of<br>
    info. This allows for less space needed &amp; allows me to just<br>
    worry with keeping wx zone info uptodate in the altplace file<br>
    Because of this the HWzipdb 1.0 and HWaltplaces 1.1 add-ons<br>
    will be combined.<br>
    (changed hw2lib.pl)</li>
  <li>Fixed bug that only parsed 1 smart temperature variable per<br>
    line. now parses correctly (chnaged hw2lib file)</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with default_icao not working<br>
    (changed hw2lib.pl)</li>
  <li>Added image map file nd-info.txt for ND image map<br>
    (created nd-info.txt file)</li>
  <li>Made modifications ot the plain sockets mode library to make it<br>
    http/1.1 compliant<br>
    (chnaged hwhttplib0.pl file)</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with rounding. If temp had a decimal and rounding<br>
    was set it woudl leave it and sometime leave on windchill and heat index<br>
    (changed hamweatherlib.pl)</li>
  <li>rewrote the use of city files to work correctly<br>
    and more effiecient<br>
    (changed hw2lib.pl)</li>
  <li>Added the ability to include perl code in your templates:<br>
    you can go: %%perl perlcodehere %%perl and HW will perform the<br>
    perl code in and replace it with the result of the code.<br>
    (chnaged hw2lib.pl)</li>
  <li>Added the ability to set User defined variables inside your<br>
    html templates by using something similar to one of the following:<br>
    %%let hwvvarname= 34 let%%<br>
    %%let hwvvarname= &quot;this is text&quot; let%%<br>
    %%let hwvvarname= $hwva = 20 + 2; $hwva let%%<br>
    (changed hw2lib.pl)</li>
  <li>Added some general remarks to the beginning of each of the<br>
    vital HW routines in the hw2lib.pl library</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with HW automatically adding the HWV variables to<br>
    the statemap, UVI table etc links when they should not have been<br>
    (Only occurred on some systems) (changed hwalib_hwv.pl and<br>
    hw2lib.pl)</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where HW would sometimes round the windchill downwards<br>
    a degree instead of upwards when the windchill was less than 32 F<br>
    (changed hamweatherlib.pl)</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with some hourly reports now showing when anything in the report<br>
    was labeled N/A</li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#000080"><strong>Changes since HAMweather 2.0 Beta 3.0</strong></font>

<ul>
  <li>Corrected Quebec Canada DB file. Thanks goto Daniel Provencher<br>
    for supplying a corrected file. (changed ca-quebec-info.txt)</li>
  <li>Added alt tags to the image map info files so that when you mouse over<br>
    a state map the county/weather zone will display. Thanks goto<br>
    Jason T. Featheringham of http://www.iqonline.net for providing the<br>
    updated files.</li>
  <li>Added the ability to have user defined variables passed along with<br>
    various HW links. (HW can auto add to the state map links, UVI links,<br>
    warning links). You can set a HWV variable to be auto transfered in<br>
    the web based admin. NOTE: It is your duty to add the<br>
    HWV variables to normal links &amp; forms (navx.html &amp; form1.html templates<br>
    and US map image maps) (changed hw2lib.pl, hamweatherlib.pl hw2wnlib.pl)</li>
  <li>Corrected spelling of Minimal in the uvi.html template (changed uvi.html file)</li>
  <li>National Summry (pro) increased effeciency. The national summary lib and GD.pm<br>
    are now only loaded if needed and the text summary table under the map is no longer<br>
    generated. (changed hamweather.cgi and hw2wslib.pl)</li>
  <li>Bought the book &quot;Mastering Regular expressions&quot; and then cleaned &amp; tweaked
    a bunch of the regular<br>
    expressions in HW. From my initial benchmarks effeciency has been boosted.<br>
    (change many files)</li>
  <li>Fixed minor bug with the warning map</li>
  <li>Added %%lcountry%% parameter that is url encoded (changed hw2lib.pl)</li>
  <li>Added nice error if zipcode is not found in the database (changed hw2lib.pl)</li>
  <li>Added support for weather to default to metric mode or not:<br>
    (defaulting to metric mode makes all farenheits to become Celsius)</li>
  <li>Added feature to set default wind unit used in metric mode</li>
  <li>Added whole slew of wind related template variables that allow<br>
    handling of wind gusts (chnaged hw2lib.pl)</li>
  <li>Added ability to set day begin &amp; day end hours used to determine<br>
    what type of icon to display for hourly/metar data</li>
  <li>Added support for time zone &amp; time zone name parameters.<br>
    if you supply tz=x where x is the hour difference from GMT then this will<br>
    override the default tz hour setting. plus if you state tz_name=XXX where<br>
    XXX is the time zone abbreviation for the TZ supplies.<br>
    NOTE: You should provide both of these otherwise your time will be<br>
    skewed. (changed hw2lib.pl file)</li>
  <li>Added correct time zone stamping to the US Summary map</li>
  <li>Updated Oregon image map info and zone file thanks to<br>
    weatherforyou.com for providing the updated info.<br>
    (changed or-info.txt and or-zones.txt)</li>
  <li>Added capability for warning map to be transposed onto the<br>
    colored us map, plus added Warning maps settings to the admin.<br>
    (changed hw2wnlib.pl, hwalib_hwpro.pl and hwanav_hwpro.txt)</li>
  <li>Added capability for cookie to store theme &amp; user settings. The sc parameter<br>
    defines what is stored in the cookie:<br>
    sc=0 : no cookie stored<br>
    sc=1 : cookie stored with no user or theme info<br>
    sc=2 : cookie stored with user info but no theme info<br>
    sc=3 : cookie stored with theme info but no user info<br>
    sc=4 : cookie stored with both user &amp; theme info<br>
    (If the user &amp; theme paramters are provideed in a url they<br>
    automatically override a cookie settings.)</li>
  <li>Cleaned out the hwcalib.pl and made it start using routines from the<br>
    hamweatherlib.pl. thus making the work easier for me to update<br>
    (changed hwcalib.pl)</li>
  <li>Added ability to add day_end &amp; day_begin parameters to URL to control<br>
    the day &amp; night time for current condition icons (specify hour in 24 hour time)<br>
    (changed hw2lib.pl)</li>
  <li>Added line to auto turn %25 into % in template. This is a work around<br>
    for Frontpage turning the normal HW variables (%%variablename%%<br>
    to %25%25variablename%25%25 HW will now correct this<br>
    before parsing. (Changed hw2lib.pl)</li>
  <li>Fixed various bugs with temperature finding for zone forecasts</li>
  <li>Added %%num_zone_days%% variable</li>
  <li>Added the ability to change the day titles in the web based admin<br>

    (changed hwalib_wxinfo.pl file)</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in statehourly with &quot;N/A&quot; sky condition showing up as<br>
    &quot;N&quot; (change hamweatherlib.pl)</li>

  <li>Added a catch in case the cache date on map data is below zero</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with HAMweather not passing the user &amp; theme parameters<br>
    in state maps</li>
  <li>Added the ability of the HAMweather include file name to be derived from<br>
    hamweather variables.. i.e. can have %%hwi=current%%metric%%%%<br>
    This would parse to %%hwi=current%% or if metric=1 then<br>
    %%hwi=current1%%</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with wind conversion not adding on the direction and units</li>
  <li>Added fix to take out &quot;links (1) and (2) new graphics&quot; stuff that IWIN added<br>
    (changed hamweatherlib.pl)</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with National forecast map sometimes displaying low temp as high temp<br>
    (changed hw2nflib.pl)</li>
  <li>Added ability: When zone forecast is not available on IWIN it will try and fetch the<br>
    individual zone forecast if possible from the NOAA thus lowering down time if a zone
    forecast<br>
    is missing on the IWIN or the IWIN goes down temporarily.</li>
  <li>Added parameter &quot;round&quot; if set to a nonzero value it will round celcius
    numbers<br>
    thus taking away the decimal point. Also added a &quot;$default_round&quot; setting to the<br>
    users/default.txt file to allow a default round method to be determined<br>
    Also added default round setting to web admin<br>
    (changed hwadmin.cgi, hamweatherlib.pl, hw2lib.pl and users/default.txt)</li>

    hourly round up if a cookie had been set (changed nav2.html na dnav3.html)</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where Mostly Sunny Current condition was displaying as<br>
    MOSUNNY. Changed HAMweatherlib.pl</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with parenthesis causing script faulure if in the zone DB<br>
    (changed hamweatherlib.pl)</li>
  <li>Fixed HW to accept SKC current condition as clear, and CAVOK as clear<br>

  <li>Fixed wrong capital name for Kansas</li>
  <li>Updated MT Zone file</li>
  <li>Decided to split the email feature out of the core HW and make it its own<br>

  <li>Added scheduling features to forecast emails (changed all various email files)</li>
  <li>Added support to allow user to enter a URL in the forecast types available IWIN portion.<br>
    This will allow user to add other simple IWIN/NWS data to HW. (changed hw2lib.pl)</li>
  <li>Added support for HW to simulate the 3 basic SSI directives:<br>
    &quot;include file&quot;, &quot;include virtual&quot;, &quot;exec&quot;. this can be used

    using a zone number and a state zone file that contained forecasts for<br>
    other states</li>
  <li>Modified all template pattern matches to use the 'o' operator so the <br>
    patterns would only be compiled once, thus hopefull speeding up.</li>
  <li>Added new variable %%imagesurl%% will be replaced with the url to <br>

    actually be in Celsius. (Changed hamweatherlib.pl and hw2lib.pl)</li>
  <li>Added Heat Index which is calculated from the Current conditions<br>
    Temp and Relative Humidity. Add %%hhif%% for Heat Index in Farenheit<br>

  <li>Redid the templates to use HWI, so now you can simply change the header.html<br>
    and footer.html files to modify the site.. (also removed all the extra embedded<br>
    tables that Frontpage had added to the templates..) (changed all template files)</li>
  <li>Fixed bug with houlry forecasts not working correctly when there was a 'space'<br>
    in the current conditions.. i.e Light Rain. (changed hamweatherlib.pl)</li>

  <li>Added limited proxy support. If you set the variable $proxy_server with the <br>
    proxy servers domain name or ip address and then set port to the port the<br>
    proxy is listing on. (If there is no proxy then make $proxy_server be a null string<br>
    and set port to '80'..this is the default.). HAMweather does not support<br>
    proxy servers that require authorization.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that when the NWS adds an extra note tothe forecast using a huge<br>
    line of stars(*) it will chop the first 30 stars from the text forecast thus keeping<br>

    goes to store a file in the cache and it has been 24 hours since the last cache<br>
    cleaning then it will erase the entire cache. (changed the hw2lib.pl file)</li>
  <li>Added support for cookies.. if the 'sc' parameter is set to 1 then the cookie<br>
    will be stored. Then if user is sent to hamweather.cgi without any parameters<br>
    set and they have a cookie it will be used to get their own default forecast,<br>
    using the alt template (if any) specified by their cookie. Also you can turn<br>
    this feature on or off. (changed files hamweather.cgi, hw2lib.pl, hamlib.pl)</li>
  <li>Removed the index.html from the package because it confused people when the <br>
    US map did not update itself.. You should now link directly to the hamweather.cgi<br>
    It will display the same map, but update itself if needed. (removed file index.html)</li>
  <li>Set the default forecast to be the US forecast map, with map mode set to 1<br>
    (changed file users/default.txt)</li>
  <li>Added output parameters. Yon can now set the output mode, 0 for web only,<br>
    1 for web &amp; file &amp; 2 for fileonly.. parameter 'om' is the output mode.<br>
    paramter 'of' is the actual output file nickname (predefined in web based<br>
    administration..for security)</li>
  <li>Fixed hwgetstate.cgi so that is a states info file contains a %25 it will turn it<br>
    into a % (hwgetstate.cgi)</li>

    but this is distibuted withthe perl Distribution and also was even needed for<br>
    the LWP module). Added the hwhttp-lib.pl file. (changed the hw2lib.pl,<br>
    hamweather.cgi, hamweatherlib.pl, hw2radarlib.pl)</li>
  <li>added the ability for user defined variables.. a user can set a form element or<br>
    pass a parameter tha begins with hwv and have the corrsponding template variable<br>
    replaced with it.. i.e. if you pass the parameter hwvcolor then in your templates<br>
    the variable %%hwvcolor%% will be replaced with the value of hwvcolor <br>
    (hw2lib.pl. metarlister.cgi, hwgetstate.cgi, /user/default.txt)</li>
  <li>Added the ability for including of files when outputting the templates.. this will<br>
    allow for easy modification to a site.. just associate the include files names with<br>
    thier file names in the user/default.txt (%hw_include). Then in the templates<br>
    simply insert %%hwi=name%% where you need a file inserted. (the name is the<br>
    name you associated with a file) (hw2lib.pl, metarlister.cgi, hwgetstate.cgi,<br>
    /user/default.txt)</li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#000080"><strong>Changes since HAMweather 2.0 Beta 1 Build 3</strong></font>

<ul>
  <li>- If a user types in the wourd &quot;county&quot; in the county name, HAMweather will
    now<br>
    strip the word &quot;county&quot; from the name and provide the forecast. For the NWS <br>
    doesn't include the word &quot;county&quot; in the zone forecasts, just the county name.<br>
    (hw2lib.pl file)<br>
  </li>
  <li>When the Current condition forecast cannot be reached HAMweather will now<br>
    state that the Curren Conditions are unavailable. (hw2lib.pl file)<br>
  </li>
  <li>If HAMweather cannot make a connection to the IWIN or NWS servers it will no<br>
    longer display the confusing &quot;Try another city/county&quot; message (hw2lib.pl file)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed bug with emailhw2.cgi that would place the name of the associated city<br>
    instead of the requested city (if associated was used.) (hw2lib.pl file)<br>
  </li>
  <li>emailhw2.cgi now supports the same template variable as does the normal<br>
    hamweather.cgi So you can add these variables to your email template<br>
    (emailhw2.cgi file)<br>
  </li>
  <li>fixed bug with associated cities not working correctly (hw2lib.pl file)<br>
  </li>
  <li>fixed bug that would not update the warning or summary maps when map_mode<br>
    was set to 2 (hw2nslib.pl and hw2wnlib.pl files)<br>
  </li>
  <li>fixed bug that would display the default place name when viewing the current <br>
    condition for an internationla city (hw2lib.pl and hamweatherlib.pl files)<br>
  </li>
  <li>fixed bug in HW admin that would cause logging to stop when you &quot;saved
    options&quot;<br>
  </li>
  <li>fixed bug in the hw2wslib.pl that would make the US summary map update to a data<br>
    set a few hours old (hw2wslib.pl file)<br>
  </li>
  <li>fixed bug with the hwadmin.cgi. In netscape the administration links did not work<br>
    correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#000080"><strong>Changes since HAMweather 2.0 Beta 1 Build 2</strong></font>

<ul>
  <li>fixed bug in the emailhw2.cgi that would cause forecasts that were not for<br>
    the default state to be unavailable. (emailhw2.cgi file)<br>
  </li>
  <li>changed the cgidie routine so that the HAMweather error message will be<br>
    printed to the screen before trying to write it to the error file. (hamlib.pl file)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Changed the Demo html templates to use the %%lplace%% variable in the url links.<br>
    This fixes the bug seen with places that had names of more than one word.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Added a %%lstate%% variable that can be used in the templates. It is just<br>
    a properly URL encoded version of the %%state%% variable. (hw2lib.pl file)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed the %%lcplace%% and %%lcstate%% variable functionality so that give<br>
    proper casing for places &amp; states with more than one word. (hw2lib.pl file)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Changed the Demo html templates to use the %%lcplace%% and %%lcstate%% variables<br>
    in the bar which states (Forecast for place, state). This fixes the bug seen <br>
    with places that had names of more than one word.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Changed the $temps_html_template variable in the theme/default.txt file to<br>
    remove the '°F'. Then changed the hamweatherlib.pl file to add the '°F' when<br>
    needed to the temps in the zone forecast. This will prevent the stray '°F' <br>
    from showing up when a temp is unavailable. (hamweatherlib.pl &amp; theme/default.txt
    files)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with Pro on some systems, especially NT. It seems that some <br>
    servers require a 'binmode' to even open and load a graphic for GD. So the <br>
    binmode command has been added to all graphic loads. This affects the<br>
    hw2wslib.pl, hw2radarlib.pl, hw2wnlib.pl, hw2nflib.pl files.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Changed hw2nflib.pl so that during a failure to open a graphics it will use the
    &amp;cgidie<br>
    routines instead of just plain die.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in the hwadmin.cgi, Administration script that would pop up when you<br>
    tried saved a default place of more than one word. The script was not correctly <br>
    putting quotes around the default place, state &amp; forecast tuype.. this bug would cause<br>
    501 server errors.<br>
  </li>
  <li>(HAMweather PRO ONLY) fixed bug in then hamweather.cgi. NOw the script will<br>
    only attempt to update the radar(when needed) during the checkign of zone or zandh <br>
    forecsats when map_mode is set greater than 0.<br>
