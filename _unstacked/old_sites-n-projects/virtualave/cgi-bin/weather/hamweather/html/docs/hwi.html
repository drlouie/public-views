<p>HAMweather allows you to easily insert files into a template during output. This can be
used to insert a common header or footer into your weather output. Thus, allowing you to
simply change a couple files to personalize your weather site. (Those familiar with SSI
will know the power of this option.).&nbsp; Currently there are two methods to use insert
files/script output into HAMweather output.&nbsp; The basic most secure method bing
HAMweather Include and the second being HAMweather Simulated Server Side Include (SSI).
&nbsp; Basical HAMweather Include is described below, followed by information on using
simulated SSI in HAmweather.<br>
<br>
<font color="#000080"><strong>Basic HAMweather Include</strong></font></p>

<p>The process of using HAMweather include (HWI) is a two step process. </p>

<p><strong>Step 1 Predefine Include Files</strong></p>

<p>You must first predefine what files can be included and give each one a 'nickname'. The
reason for this is better security. You can do this by using the web based administration
HAMweather Include page. HAMweather comes with the following include files preset:</p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table border="2" bordercolor="#000080" cellpadding="2" bordercolorlight="#000080"
bordercolordark="#000080" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><table border="0" bgcolor="#FFFFD7" height="98">
      <tr>
        <td height="21" align="center" colspan="2"><strong><font color="#000080">HAMweather
        Include Presets</font></strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td height="21" align="center"><strong>Nickname</strong></td>
        <td height="21" align="center"><strong>Filename</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td height="21" align="center">header</td>
        <td height="21" align="center">header.html</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td height="21" align="center">footer</td>
        <td height="21" align="center">footer.html</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td height="21" align="center">nav1</td>
        <td height="21" align="center">nav1.html</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td height="21" align="center">nav2</td>
        <td height="21" align="center">nav2.html</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td height="21" align="center">nav3</td>
        <td height="21" align="center">nav3.html</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td height="21" align="center">form1</td>
        <td height="21" align="center">form1.html</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center></div>

<p>The include files are set to be in the /templates/include directory of your HAMweather
install.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2 Insert HWI command into templates.</strong></p>

<p>The second step to using HWI is to insert the HWI command into your templates. To do
this, add the following in your templates where you want the file inserted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#000080">%%hwi=nickname%%</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where 'nickname' is the predefined nickname of the file that you want to include. <font
color="#FF0000">For Example: If we wanted to include the header file we would use the
following:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#000080">%%hwi=header%%</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, all included files go through the HAMweather parse engine, so you can include
HAMweather variables in the files to be included as well. Actually you could even have an
include file include a second file if needed.</p>

<p><strong><font color="#000080">Simualted Server Side Include</font></strong></p>

<p>Many people use Server Side include to insert ads and/or other information&nbsp; into
their html documents.&nbsp; Many of these same users would like to do the same with the
HAMweather Output. (i.e. add banner ads tot he HAmweather output.).&nbsp; You may think
that you can simply add the SSI directives to the HAmweather templates and as HAmweather
sent out the output the webv server would catch these SSI commands and parse them as well.
Weel in an ideal world this woudl work , but becauseof security reasons etc, most web
server will not perform SSI parsing on the output of a CGI script.&nbsp; Because of this,
HAMweather can simulate&nbsp; three commonly used SSI commands.</p>

<p>First you must turn SSI simulation capabilities on.&nbsp; To do this you will need to
open the hwconfig.txt file and set the &quot;$allow_SSI&quot; to '1'.&nbsp; Thus the line
would look similar to:<br>
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $allow_SSI = 1;</font></p>

<p>To torn the SSI Simulation capability off then you simply set the value back to zero:<br>
<font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $allow_SSI = 0;</font></p>

<p>Now that SSI simulation capability is turned on you will simply add the SSI commands to
your HAMweather templates and HAmweather will parse them as it outputs your templates.
&nbsp; The following three basic SSI directives are supported (Note they may act slightly
different from the real SSI counterparts):</p>

<p><font color="#000080">&quot;Include File&quot; Directive</font>:&nbsp; &lt;!--#include
file=&quot;/path/to/file&quot;--&gt;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This command will insert a file into the HAmweather output.&nbsp; Basically it is very
  similar to the way that the basic HAMweather include works.&nbsp; You must set file equal
  to a complete file path or it can be set to relative path to a file that is in the users
  'include' directory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#000080">&quot;Include Virtual&quot; Directive:</font> &lt;!--#include
virtual=&quot;URLtofileorscript&quot;--&gt;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This command will insert a file or script output into the HAmweather output.&nbsp; You
  must set 'virtual' equal to a relative or full url to the file or script to include.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#000080">&quot;Exec CMD&quot; Directive: </font>&lt;!--#exec
cmd=&quot;path/to/script&quot;--&gt;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This command willinsert theoutput of a script/program into the hamweather output.
  &nbsp; CMD must be set equal to a full path or to a url to a script.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>NOTE</strong></font>:&nbsp; The use of SSI simulation,
like normal SSI,&nbsp; can lower security on yoru server, thus it should only be used when
absolutely needed.</p>
