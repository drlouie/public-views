<p><font color="#FF0000">HAMweather</font> is a <font color="#000080"><big>FREE</big></font>
weather software package that can be used to add custom weather capabilities to your web
site.&nbsp; These added weather forecasting abilities will provide the user interactivity
you need&nbsp; to keep your web visitors coming back. &nbsp; HAMweather can be installed
on a Unix, Windows NT or&nbsp; a Windows 95/98 web server with minimal effort.&nbsp;
HAMweather&nbsp; also adds the ability for ISP's to set up a single installation and have
multiple clients create their own custom weather site.</p>

<p>HAMweather comes in three flavors: HAMweather Pro, Standard and Lite.&nbsp; You can
choose the version that best suits your needs and requirements and remember it doesn't
matter which version you choose, they are all FREE.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">HAMweather Standard</font>, is the base weather system allowing
  users to get weather forecasts for the US and canada,&nbsp; current conditions for cities
  through out the world, clickable state image maps.</p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">HAMweather Pro</font>, provides all the features in HAMweather
  Standard and also allows for additional features such as dynamic forecast, summary and
  warning map generation.</p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">HAMweather Lite</font>, is a stripped down version of HAMweather
  Standard.&nbsp; This version only allows for the basic use of fetching weather forecasts
  for the US and canada.&nbsp; This version is useful for sites that do not have the space
  or need for all of the HAMweather features.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To expand the capabilities of HAMweather further there are several FREE add-ons that
may be installed.&nbsp; Such as HWemail, HWscroll, and HWimage.</p>

    <td width="100%"><strong><font color="#FFFFFF">How does HAMweather work?</font></strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>HAMweather allows users to obtain weather forecasts and other various weather
information using a web interface.</p>

<p>When the user requests weather information, HAMweather will obtain the text data, as
needed, from the <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov">National Weather Service (NWS)</a>, the
<a href="http://weather.gov">Interactive Weather Information Network (IWIN)</a> and the <a
href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/">Environmental Canada</a>.&nbsp; The raw data is then parsed,
cleaned up and presented to the user in a nice, clean customized web page.</p>

<p>You can easily customize HAMweather by editing html templates. Thus, allowing you to
have complete control over the look and feel of your weather site.</p>

  </tr>

<p>HAMweather Pro needs the same requirements as HAMweather with one exception.&nbsp; The
Perl GD.pm module must be installed on your server for the dynamic maps to be generated.
&nbsp; If you are not sure if the Perl GD.pm module is installed on your server then
contact your system administrator or use the Pre-install Test script included in the
HAMweather distribution.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong>NOTE</strong></font>: GIF support is in GD.pm 1.19 and
earlier.&nbsp; PNG support only in GD.pm 1.20 through 1.25. PNG and JPEG support in GD.pm
1.26.&nbsp; Unix users can download gd.pm from CPAN at: <a
href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/by-module/GD/">http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/by-module/GD/</a>
&nbsp; NT users should have your Provider install the module via the Perl package manager
(PPM).</p>
